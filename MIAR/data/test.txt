Great software  outdated interface Great software.

I really just wanted to leave feedback for the developers and have no interest in rating the app but I didn't see a customer service contact or anything like that.
INFORMATION GIVING
But still some fixes they fix it i will be happy :-)
INFORMATION GIVING
First  the rectangles where the auto complete text options are located in do not change length to accommodate the length of the text.
INFORMATION GIVING
It works but why it automatically stops and open again and again.anybody plz give answer.

It can be faster than using other apps if used with hackers keyboard or some other keyboard with esc ctrl etc
INFORMATION GIVING
Used to work really well Loved this app.
INFORMATION GIVING
For example: sort by time of reminder  sort alphabetically  sort by date added  etc.

INFORMATION GIVING
Please make the full update A.S.A.P. Well.
INFORMATION GIVING
Okay so i left a 4 star review because the habit x times a week didn't seem to be ignoring days i didn't want to mark down a habit on  but the app seems to learn the days you don't do and places a grey tick  it just takes a little while to work.
INFORMATION GIVING
Request Plz change the black colour of top portion into green  blue  red  pink yellow or brown.
INFORMATION GIVING
Many useful options that other firewalls can only dream of.

INFORMATION GIVING
Just what I was looking for Had a nice collection of mod files that I was looking for a way to play.

INFORMATION GIVING
I almost update this app but didn't happen
INFORMATION GIVING
Doesn't quite do what it says This app simply places filters over the screen.
INFORMATION GIVING
You have to hit beside the buttons instead of hitting them.
INFORMATION GIVING
I'm sure it serves its purpose well for those who truly need it & I think it's a great idea  but for me it's just a nuisance.
INFORMATION GIVING

If I remember correctly the outlines of the astrological signs connecting stars were beautifully outlined and displayed clearly when you passed your phone throughout the Sky.that was removed.

Quick alarm settings made out a 5 start for me.

A replacement for Google Chrome It was a foolish move for Google to not add duckduckgo into their short list of default search engines  and even more foolish to not have the ability to add your own added by now.

Yes forget the rest here is the best!
INFORMATION GIVING
I would also like to have more control over reminders based on day of the week.

Don't slow my phone
INFORMATION GIVING
No ads which is a plus.

INFORMATION GIVING
Better move buttons little bit left side.
INFORMATION GIVING
Great app love how it's works and the powerful file sharing.
INFORMATION GIVING
You have to close out the app to get it to clear.
INFORMATION GIVING
Perfect App This app is just GREAT.It let you sign in with your google account in MANY MANY apps or games'very immportant in some games like CLASH OF CLANS.How it works is it can save the memory(not sure if the word memory is correct)because you signed in through google account'so you don't need to restart the entire game!This app also connects Youtube which is a great apo too!So keep your negative comments to yourself
INFORMATION GIVING
Very Good but  Nice app but pressing home button wud take directly to the home screen without unlocking through this app.
INFORMATION GIVING
But it has all other information I have searched for.
INFORMATION GIVING
I am a little concerned about privacy here.
INFORMATION GIVING
Great app!
INFORMATION GIVING
great minimalistic launcher provides instant relief from colored icons and other typical GUI-crap widely in use these days.
INFORMATION GIVING
Ridiculous Grindfest You have to spend a ridiculous amount of time grinding to afford anything halfway decent  whether it be food or gear  not to mention how levels require like ten times more experience than was required for the previous level.
INFORMATION GIVING
App review App is not compatible with with alcatel one touch
INFORMATION GIVING
Its so boring to update this.app.and because this is not updated other app won't run What a stupid deal.waste of time and storage.
INFORMATION GIVING
Awesome app Love the updates and the app works wonderfully.
INFORMATION GIVING
Another thing that I realised after starting to use the launcher was that I'm no longer mindlessly opening apps like Facebook  Twitter or WhatsApp just because i see the icons on homescreen.
INFORMATION GIVING
Don't spend all your time at festivals juggling alone instead of passing.
INFORMATION GIVING
Developers  you MUST adapt this app to touchscreen devices!
INFORMATION GIVING

INFORMATION GIVING
Knowledge Knowledge is important for your life and this app good for increased knowledge
INFORMATION GIVING
Also  instead of 5 different font sizes  make an option to enter exact percentage because 3rd option is too small and 4th is a bit too big.
INFORMATION GIVING
However  when I set the corners not to overlap the status bar  it looks kinda weird when the status bar doesn't have a solid black color  sometimes it imitates the main color of some apps (like red on YouTube or green on LINE).
INFORMATION GIVING
Love it Just keep up the good work
INFORMATION GIVING
My homework Ok if i do not under stand stuff i just use this app i can even use this app to help me with my homework
INFORMATION GIVING
Some good features  but terribly annoying banner adds For an app that is seemingly privacy conscious  allowing an annoying  blinking ""1 virus found"" banner adds is such a shame and makes me no longer trust the integrity of the app.
INFORMATION GIVING
Is there some way ya'll could fix this?
INFORMATION GIVING
Really good app This app really do what it says.

You can keep track on free minutes in your phone plan.

The positioning and touch sensitivity seem a little buggy at times though.

Thank you for this great application 馃槉.

Takes a lot of space I have to clear it every other day because it takes up half of my storage.
INFORMATION GIVING
Themes feature is a good idea.
INFORMATION GIVING
This app could be perfect if it just use memory less than 10mb
INFORMATION GIVING
If you are looking for an app to help you build decks and stuff look no further.

This is pure text messaging app and send & receive HD quality pictures and videos I love telegram and please don't add video calling and voice calling please please please
INFORMATION GIVING
And the way it's done (ads added via upgrade  ad removal suggested through in-app purchase) feels like a trap to make you pay  enough to make me gladly pay for another app which offers lock screen controls (Dsub).
INFORMATION GIVING
Need to alot of update...video calling feature should added.
INFORMATION GIVING
Good emulator tho.
INFORMATION GIVING
Great app.
INFORMATION GIVING

Best mpd app I am really shocked to read that this app shall be removed from playstore.

The only downside here is that there is no end to the game.

I hate stickers in this Please urge your company to remove the stickers as insulting to Buddhism here And indeed worried about what to include such
INFORMATION GIVING
This is wack You have to update it 1million times

As you say  Frostwire does NOT have viruses  you are completely right  but you follow in writing that torrents DO have a chance of having viruses  so yes  you technically just busted yourself  risking to get viruses is a stupid move and no one should ever have to risk such for torrents.

*Update*: Found out my phone was the problem  sooo yeah  you need a very performant phone to run DS games with no lag  as for the app  perfect  simple 10/10.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ehhh Bugs need to be fixed keeps crashing left and right for no reason pleeeeeease fix
FEATURE REQUEST
need to be fix ASAP.
FEATURE REQUEST
One suggestion Would be great if there was a pixel scaling feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's ok Wish it ran faster.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could give it -5 stars :D Screw this!
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be great if you added a menu button to the screen or made the long press on the back button work within the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
So I think you should fix it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Come on man please These comment is for the creator of these emulator OK so I just fixed the lag myself all I need you to do is add a lot more speed like they my boy times 2 speed OK if you can do that I'll give u five stars to fix the lag turn the frame skip to 0 OK so Now all I need is speed
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but force closes I can play my ROMs but I need to keep saving as it randomly closes down.
FEATURE REQUEST
Dosnt work You need to install other things
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to have a tutorial to get games How do you get games
FEATURE REQUEST
Non-stop lag on Pok?mon heart gold  even without sound  still lags so now not only did the fps gave me cancer and the lack of sound makes me feel deaf
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make it faster
FEATURE REQUEST
Too many stuff Every time I Go on it  there is an add and takes me home!
FEATURE REQUEST
Why is there no sound not even 1 sound effect and it's really slow
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice emulator  i would love to see a fast-forward button added to the emulator  tough!
FEATURE REQUEST
It keeps stopping before I can save but its runs not so smoothly but it can use an update soon.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Emu  needs update!
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great It had everything i needed to play
FEATURE REQUEST
Like i like it.it works nearly perfect.it needs a little speed.that's all.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to save progress I was playing pokemon pearl then i saved and stopes playing when i go nack i have to restart dont waste your time this emulator does not save
FEATURE REQUEST
This emulator is all I need to play my favorite NDS games.
FEATURE REQUEST
My opinion dislike Ok so when i started pokemon black i was really happy and all so it started of with proffesor juniper and i chose boy  i got a pokemon snivy and when you need to follow proffesor juniper thats where i got stuck my pokemon wouldnt level up after a battle not even with bianca and cheren wich i thought was unsaual and maby later it will gain exp but no and my second problem is i cant save well i can but when i get off and get back on i have to start my whole game over this probably has to do with emulator
FEATURE REQUEST
Cool but u need to add cheats ok!!
FEATURE REQUEST
please add fast forward option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it but Just wish it play the games I want lol but still love it must have.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cool Cool emulator but you have to fix some bugs
FEATURE REQUEST
It's OK but It's needs a fast forward button on it so I can get done faster
FEATURE REQUEST
Good I like the emulator but add the fast forward as the my boy
FEATURE REQUEST
When I was done adding cheats I try them I access my inventory then game crash.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to make it little faster when i play pokemon pearl its reaaalllyyy slow and maybe also maybe add a feature to make the game go faster
FEATURE REQUEST
Idk wassup It keeps closing before I start my game you need to fix it
FEATURE REQUEST
And also  you need to change the way the Emu works.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's OK But I think that if this new was fast it would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be great if it wasn't so slow but other wise It's great and I can play pokemon again ?
FEATURE REQUEST
Lags to much need to fix that when I play pokemon
FEATURE REQUEST
Yall Need To Worked On This App.
FEATURE REQUEST
Speed button please Please add a speed button and i will give it 5 stars
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app It's a great app but lacks only one thing.....speed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fast button please to slow All it Needs is a fast button and it would be great
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be good if you could speed things up like the gba emulator other then that its good.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its good just need to be updated
FEATURE REQUEST
So slow Please add a fast forward button soon or I'll remove the app
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app Missing screen rotation the same should be inbuilt like gameboy software
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for this app I would really like to see this app shine some day come on you can do it
FEATURE REQUEST
Dear developer please respond with updates If you add the possibility of saving my games directly to the EXTSDCARD I will give 5 stars
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add a speed button?
FEATURE REQUEST
There's something missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
the emulator plays well even its slightly slow you need a ""portrait"" and ""landscape"" option  switching from main screen to the second screen prompt by pressing a button  your START'SELECT and TOUCH button are too small for my big fingers and lastly improve the fps of the emulator because I really want to play Pokemon Diamond and Castlevania:Dawn of Sorrows.
FEATURE REQUEST
The options and layout leave a lot to be desired though in my opinion  app needs to be simpler and going back and fro while searching for ROMs needs to be pleasant.
FEATURE REQUEST
need to fix that's On my Samsung Grand core Prime don't matter what emulator I downloaded none of my Pokemon will gain experience points or go up levels
FEATURE REQUEST
Just need to be fixed sounds and faster  smoother game play but beside that; it is still a great emulator.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also I really appreciate that you put hard work to make this easy-to-use emulator and people need to know that all emulators are supposed to be slow  because the games are meant to be played on Ds and some ROMs don't work because they just don't work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some games like Phoenix Wright which rely a lot on their music as cues would be so much better if played with decent sound.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fast forward and cheats Add gameshark codes like option .
FEATURE REQUEST
No sound : ( Would be great if it had sound and also if the like settings to like exit and open would work but all it does is pause the screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs a bit of work If there's a way to prevent the app from crashing every few minutes  that would be great
FEATURE REQUEST
this is incredible If the emulator is slow  you can change frame skip setting for best performance.
FEATURE REQUEST
Slow  needs more improvement.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs more speed and less lag it's OK and all but if I were to give it 5 stars it would mean the world to me for you to fix the lag
FEATURE REQUEST
Good job It's very useful i didn't expect that you can create this kind of emulator  it's means a lot to an old school player.Good job!
FEATURE REQUEST
YO this is a better emelater then DraSitk DraStic sucks but please add the Hot dog mode what i mean bro is the sideways if you have any questions answer me im all ears ok well bye!?
FEATURE REQUEST
I just need one good emulator for pokemon
FEATURE REQUEST
This emulator needs more credit This emulator is as good as it gets for mobile use.
FEATURE REQUEST
No speed up button or fast forward this need to be added its so slow please update it and i will change my rating to five stars
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but needs to be quicker.
FEATURE REQUEST
It still needs an improvement By the way.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think it needs a video plugin .
FEATURE REQUEST
Paint drying moves quicker As the title suggests the game moves crazy slow  I'd guess its at 1/4 or 1/5 of the real pace it should move at.
FEATURE REQUEST
Crashing Bug Normally I will be able to find a work Around but I couldn't get a ROM to run properly.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nds emulators Seeing as nds emulators are so early on in development  I can't say that this is terrible  but it still needs some work to get on the level of that paid emulator (don't remember the name lol).
FEATURE REQUEST
Overall really good just need to fix that small issue.
FEATURE REQUEST
Laggy but good IF REALLY GOOD U JUST NEED TO WORK ON IT LITTLE
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent emulator DEAR DEV PLEASE ADD HIGH RESOLUTION 3D RENDERING JUST LIKE DRASTIC for 5 stars
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish everyone would learn to appreciate all the effort that's gone into getting this emulator as good as it is (even if it could be improved).
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it didn't lag It's great to have this app for free but when I decided to play Pok?mon  it lagged a lot.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could make it just a little bit faster it'd be great
FEATURE REQUEST
Upset I wish I could play the games because the app keep exiting out
FEATURE REQUEST
How can I make my fps better?
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm sure there is a way to change this (yes I'm aware I can remove the controls by clicking touch  but then they're not there at all)  but there is no way for me to access the app's options (thats if there are any  which would really surprise me if there was not).
FEATURE REQUEST
great app Speed mode would be great
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great but still needs work Works great but still needs work
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm not sure if you're still making updates but I hope you can put a speed up update like the GBA emulators bc frameskips isn't doing much its kinda laggy but still playable but would love for it to run at normal speed
FEATURE REQUEST
ARP file that aren't being imported and there is no manual way that I can see to import then
FEATURE REQUEST
wish i could give 0 stars to this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty awesome..missing two things Finds and opens nds files well.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is missing the speed mods.
FEATURE REQUEST
If that could be added as soft buttons or as an option to add them as soft buttons then that would be it  it would be a 5 in my book.
FEATURE REQUEST
Crash This app loads game then crashes when i try and play pokemon black you need to update this app so it doesn't crash
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to be faster Just need to make the games a tad bit faster and it crashes way too often.
FEATURE REQUEST
An update to fix this glitch would be nice!
FEATURE REQUEST
A scooch more fps plz that would be great
FEATURE REQUEST
No sound Games work put there is no sound at all you need to fix this problem
FEATURE REQUEST
Need Fastword Button It's okay but need a button for a fastword.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs more speed Awesome but lacks speed.
FEATURE REQUEST
And you should consider adding a fast forward button.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  it needs to solve its performance and lagging issues.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like that u can disable fog effect though  would be useful for anyone who can get that far.
FEATURE REQUEST
TOO SLOW NEEDS to be updated
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app It's nice but someone needs to maintain his project as the dev is not able to do it
FEATURE REQUEST
Best download manager but basic functions are missing Best download manager I ever used but basic function are missing like opening of downloaded file option  pause status detail   no file format auto detection while saving   multiple or single download option
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs Android integration When clicking on a link to download  there should be an intent to use the app instead of having to copy/paste or having to open it in another browser [-2 stars until fixed  important app operation].
FEATURE REQUEST
Loved it but bugs need to be resolved for marshmallow App functions upto browser and fails during downloading of video
FEATURE REQUEST
However  it needs more features like being able to set the default download folder and download different file types in different folders by default  and capturing download links from browser.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if you can add support for apache password protected files
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Only improvement would be optional lubber line  bezel and side view window to mimic a scuba compass.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need current reading mark (red line that cross scale in my side for precise read).
FEATURE REQUEST
But missing option to select magnetic north or true north.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just works No unnecessary permissions :) But looks ugly  you need to redo graphics.
FEATURE REQUEST
No annoying add.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need a magnet position sensor of some kind  my phone don't have one.
FEATURE REQUEST
all I need could have more info but yes it does watch traffic on your device.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have an app that monitors rate of traffic  but I needed a graph/log.
FEATURE REQUEST
2) adding possibility of reading the contents of the packets.
FEATURE REQUEST
App doesn't work says it needs root access It sure would have been helpful if the author had specified that the app requires root access
FEATURE REQUEST
Extremely useful  specially when you need network usage info without wanting to go down to packet sniffing level.
FEATURE REQUEST
It lacks many features!
FEATURE REQUEST
But for me it would be nice if it could start an app on my phone  from the list.
FEATURE REQUEST
1 would be nice if it could remember the folder you were last in on next load.
FEATURE REQUEST
Quite good app  would be nice to play from selected position tho.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cant find which song im playing in folder and add fav playlist Add option to show filename on player and number of song on both on player and on folder.
FEATURE REQUEST
--I suggest you to add option to send files around to make a folder with fav songs.also need an option to add a song from 1 playlist to another.
FEATURE REQUEST
---also i detected little bit stuttering with my mod songs (interference protracker M.K.) also add option for adding song to playlist directly from player.
FEATURE REQUEST
A great trip down memory lane I only wish it supported even more old school formats (Amiga custom  SID  SAP.)
FEATURE REQUEST
If i could have a special request to have an option for mono sound that would be great for me!
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if the file browser actually allowed you to navigate to the files  rather than Han having to manually type a path each time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if user wouldnt need to set looping all over again for each selected track
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there would be a 6 star rating.
FEATURE REQUEST
...but I really would like to be able to view messages in .it modules.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to have access to the genre filters to make it more useful.
FEATURE REQUEST
:D (I needed to restart my old phone 2 times to make it work better again.)
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice one File selection should be done better thou.
FEATURE REQUEST
Plays almost every modules  but are missing a few.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  it's lacking support for MO3 format that is widely used in PopCap's games.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only major fault i can find is lack of SNDH (Atari ST) format.
FEATURE REQUEST
best tracker player for android one minus - will be nice to see recursive directory playing option (hope will be implemented in near future) .
FEATURE REQUEST
Been using for years.The best 2 features I would love to see 1) ability to read song message in IT files 2) a way to hide the upper song title and lower player controls when watching the scrolling notes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had CIFS support  then it would be 10 stars!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was a way to go into a playlist  turn on shuffle  select a song to play  and have it shuffle play after that song is over.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way to get shuffle to work is by going into a playlist  turning on shuffle  and hitting the ""play"" button  so it starts with a random song.
FEATURE REQUEST
However it would be nice to have a faster way to add many files to a playlist at once.
FEATURE REQUEST
A checklist option and the ability to set reminders would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great  but please [Add] : Sorting capacity  it'll be great  thanks.
FEATURE REQUEST
Overall bugs need to be corrected aswell  the app crashes once in a bad while.
FEATURE REQUEST
I use it everyday but it wont sync to my new phone.would be nice if all tge transaction section add up the expenses for the year.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's exactly what I need to stick to my budget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add a tutorial.
FEATURE REQUEST
The beauty of it is that you can add lots of envelopes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple Easy to use I would give it 5 stars but it seems to be missing one important (to me) feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
So when I get a paycheck it would be nice to automatically divide it into my envelopes instead of manual entry.
FEATURE REQUEST
You can color code envelopes  add a note to any input or out put and it doesn't pressure you to keep to a schedule like some other apps.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app Just wish I could change the distribution amount each paycheck.
FEATURE REQUEST
UI could use some work Seems like it could be a useful app  although I haven't really gotten the hang of it yet.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nearly perfect Just what I need a nice simple app.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would also be nice if you could sort or rearrange the envelopes.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if envelopes could be set to automatically refill based on the month.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if we can unlock the app with fingerprint.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to allow access to storage and additional permission to encrypt n decrypt.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks custom fields.
FEATURE REQUEST
If no changes happened  then backup may not be necessary.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to fix update backups not accessible!
FEATURE REQUEST
I have used this since came out Loved it but now it will not create Backup or restore file-The update 1.4.2 you can do a backup but cannot restore from the backups-You cannot select them to be restored- I have both a Samsung S4 android 4.4.4 & a HTC M9 android 6.0 neither one can restore from the backups- Uninstalled 1.4.2 & reinstalled 1.4.1 & it works fine- You need to fix!I have been using OI Safe since came out & it is Great application how ever this update does not work properly!
FEATURE REQUEST
Saved backup file to my memory card because of changing my phone  but when I try to recover it  all I get is an error message about a missing line.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sign in should be able to access all my passwords
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to reset the master password.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app so i need the backup fixed.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you don't see backup and restore from the drop down menu then it means you need to scroll down on the menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Android wear support would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
What makes this app great is the lack of online interaction.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to be able to back up the database directly to Dropbox - that would make it 5 star for me!
FEATURE REQUEST
Should of read reviews regarding backup and lollipop Worked fine for several phone transfers  before new phone backed up switched phones and tried to import data and nothing.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a way to sync between my devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can still add entries and delete them  but not edit them.
FEATURE REQUEST
A cloud backup feature would be useful.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I tried to restore backup found backup directory and file gone.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's not really OI Safe fault but I wish they'd make some updates to address Android Kitkat's new SD card restrictions.
FEATURE REQUEST
It will be good to have possibility to sort completed animes by start or finish date.
FEATURE REQUEST
Today  I opened the app to update my list but then the Manga List wouldn't show anything.
FEATURE REQUEST
EDIT : I think the general tab and detail tab need to be merge.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just a browser UPDATE: I only that it needs something but I'll try.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  it would be nice if there was an option of both airing or aired  or dis-select an option because i dont care about it.
FEATURE REQUEST
(Bug Report) When I add (+) an anime to my list and slide down to refresh the anime's page  it resets to its initial state  so it'd be good to use the slide down event to save besides the 'back' click.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love the UI Wish there was simultaneous MAL and Anilist!
FEATURE REQUEST
Kinda works I can add things from this app but OT doesn't say oh added them and I can't see my lists only if I go on the actual my anime list website can I see everything up to date  it's been like this for months now
FEATURE REQUEST
Also a ""today"" would be useful as well
FEATURE REQUEST
What it lacks: - ""broadcast on"" dates on certain anime title bar under titles & I have watched lines (it would be cool to get it on main page instead of browsing countless subpages; OR: -notification when the next episode is out.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if we could change blue color at the top to different color so It would match with the bg.
FEATURE REQUEST
And the ability to view the clubs we manage and are a member of as well as threads that we are watching would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Seeing own rating I would like to see the score/rating I have given to an anime and also its total number of episodes below its name   on the thumbnails.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wanna try but?
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be useful  cause I'm not really sure when/if my change is getting saved to server.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only need one thing from this app and that's having the ""hamburger"" (what I press the +1 our mall complete) move to the left side so I don't accidentally scroll up and down.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add it!
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you guys make it a streaming to because that would be awesome
FEATURE REQUEST
Its okay The ui's great but you should make the sorting easier like sort our manga or anime by our progress on it.if you do it I will rate this 5 star
FEATURE REQUEST
Could Be Better Aside from the minor negative of the Holo-esque sliding tabs  the app just needs to create more efficient use of space.
FEATURE REQUEST
(*nudge* You could add an option for light cards for the main pages!
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is grt But lack one thing.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could add club feature it would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
For now i will give 4馃専 once you add club option 5馃専 is for you.
FEATURE REQUEST
Idiot app This app need account fuck dumb and I'm done to create it only work in Website useless apps JUST DELETE THIS APP.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great BUT THIS NEEDS AN EXPLICIT CONTENT FILTER!
FEATURE REQUEST
I would be great but.
FEATURE REQUEST
A sorting feature would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Feature request Could you please add a custom view?
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to see a media/folder indexer so Atarashii could update automatically.
FEATURE REQUEST
love it its awesome but you need to add folders so people can make folders and list the anime like a specific anime and all of its seasons
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could give it 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
If I may make a suggestion   add a feature in the planned to watch section to quick add it to watching.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be better when you press complete  it would automatically put 12/12 etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
It could be better It could be better if syncing could be faster  like other MAL apps it doesnt take long to update a list or load one.
FEATURE REQUEST
Don't know if this is an API limitation  but would be nice to filter out the hentai from upcoming.
FEATURE REQUEST
details add basic info of the anime & manga  pls
FEATURE REQUEST
Crash issues If possible we need to get the crashing to stop  specifically when you update any aspect.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  but needs to improve In my list  it must display everything but organized !
FEATURE REQUEST
Details would be better if there were descriptive stats.
FEATURE REQUEST
e.g Start and Finnish dates  Genres ect ...missing a star ;(
FEATURE REQUEST
9/10 only needs ability to view friends MALs.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only thing this app is missing is more editing options for the manga and anime you're watching  like tags  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Search Search could be improved  it doesn't return results unless you write the exact name of the anime/manga.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app Better than the other MAL apps that I used  only missing the feature to show the sequels lhe anime h谩s.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nearly there A good app  but missing a few features i regularly use.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing I'd like to see added is having the app automatically add the date started/completed when you set a show to watching or completed.
FEATURE REQUEST
i wish the app was more appealing to the eye and has beautiful and stunning layout 馃槏 only then i will give it 5/5
FEATURE REQUEST
(^_^) But if I can give a suggestion  you could add things like ""Start Date/Finish Date"" and an easy way to find relative stories (sequels  side stories  etc) so we can know if the anime/manga we're following has some kind of continuation.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing is a link to open a selected anime/manga in the mal website.
FEATURE REQUEST
Every time needed to search in Google play and open from there.
FEATURE REQUEST
It may be lost somewhere in my files or permanently deleted.
FEATURE REQUEST
I WISH I HAD A LOWER RATE LIKE -5 !!
FEATURE REQUEST
Rooted Device I kept getting a failure notice on almost all of the apps that should not have had any problems with being moved to system and vice versa.
FEATURE REQUEST
Once you install busy box from the play store you need to open it and hit install in the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cool but It would be better if big apks are moved too
FEATURE REQUEST
Only could use better UI to prevent misunderstanding.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to move ""APN Backup & Restore"" to system so I can delete some APN's.
FEATURE REQUEST
Seriously though great app amazing price and if you don't know what you are doing it will mess things up.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some old compiler packages like gfortran needs to be added to the repo  however.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had better help section When I had to clean-slate my Android system - and thus reinstall this app - I couldn't install the PERL JSON (which before had really not been a problem).
FEATURE REQUEST
--- In a sense  this inspired an improvement to my program by getting it to use JSON:PP rather than JSON - still  I no reason why there should be no help docs on how to do what I was able to do in this app in the past.
FEATURE REQUEST
No user imput possible I need to test a script that inclufes user imput  but apparently no one can do something that simple!
FEATURE REQUEST
However i love stripped CLI but needs More modern features as I am working on small screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Control to Stop Execution Just one option missing  there should be a control to stop the execution of the command  it is going in the infinite loop.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to save.
FEATURE REQUEST
One thing that slightly frustrates me is that the software repo is kind of small and does not contain Haskell  which I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Using this on chromeos and it is finally the missing peice of the puzzle to make chromebook the ultimate budget laptop.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing software buttons like [tab]  all function and cursor keys.
FEATURE REQUEST
Useful  needs SD access A useful tool but needs to be able to access the whole SD card
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app App is working great if it can be add ctrl  shift and tab key in bord so it helps to do some extra .
FEATURE REQUEST
It would also be nice to have a popup Menu that has the excape key ctrl and arrow keys.
FEATURE REQUEST
My go-to tool  just wish it was compatible with older versions of Android.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's good devs are trying to get a real terminal on droids Thanks  I am going to try it out again  there are some in the interwebs saying with your app I can use traditional cmd line.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add a fearure to remove selected notifications  or all history.
FEATURE REQUEST
Each reminder should have 'inactive hours.'
FEATURE REQUEST
Good to do app Please add option to change default settings (time  color  repeat  etc).
FEATURE REQUEST
I typically add tasks for the day in the morning but it won't appear on widget cuz it defaults to next day.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be an option to customise the widget  like adjusting the opacity  size of font and reminders  and themes.
FEATURE REQUEST
I will give this app 5 stars if you add my suggestions.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some suggestions from me: some different icons would be good.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing is a widget ...just something to keep a tab on your reminders ..would be great if that could be implemented in future .
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you add a dark theme as well?
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed something clean  lightweight  and above all FAST.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice It's a very nice app  but I can feel the lack of a widget!
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect and simple It lacks sync in order to become a true 5 star.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good I'd like to be able to change folder names  or delete them.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd also like to be able to remove the extra click required to mark something complete or done.
FEATURE REQUEST
But need reccuring task
FEATURE REQUEST
Add sync feature as well It would be great  if you add Google account sync access.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if  when creating a new task  it appears by default at the top of the list so it's easy to find and move when you have a long list.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be much better if.
FEATURE REQUEST
Integration with Google tasks or Reminders would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also a swipe option to Snooze like Inbox by Google gives would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
very cool please add widget
FEATURE REQUEST
Lovely design Would really love to see recurring reminders in this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs cloud sync Love this program but really needs a cloud sync feature to allow settings to be restored or transferred to new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great to have a fav button so you can quickly tag to save a pod cast you want to keep.
FEATURE REQUEST
It should be able to keep playing and do that at the same time.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only solution is to erase the history for that subscription and start again  deleting the duplicates.
FEATURE REQUEST
Later additions to the feed seem to download correctly but some of my subscriptions missed that middle bunch for a while.
FEATURE REQUEST
UI needs just minor updates and improvements.
FEATURE REQUEST
Should have a button to quickly switch to podcast list.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but can't sort This app is great  I even got my techy husband using it :-) But it needs to sort each podcast into folders or something!
FEATURE REQUEST
I wanted to catalogue a ton of books ...some I have read and some I need to read and prioritise.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Been using this app for a while now and it does everything i need it to.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have this app on my phone so I never have to worry about if I have a book or not.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very flexible and filled with features  except  a mark for 1st/2nd editions  it would be great if it would also come up on the list mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome Wish it was easier to create own genre names as the ones that come with the book are generally odd.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  needs to be simpler to back up to memory card  I lost everything when my phone went into a boot loop and I never knew the backup was on phone and not in memory card.
FEATURE REQUEST
Their latest book and the option to see more books by the author takes you to amazon where you can buy the books but not add them to the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to be able to add book covers to the books.
FEATURE REQUEST
What I wanted Fairly easy  would like to be able to delete once saved  like ability to catalog books as rea  to read which volume in series good app
FEATURE REQUEST
Any chance that library of Congress call numbers could be added to the fields?
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but needs cloud synch Good app but needs update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to be able to turn sound of scanning off rather than making people open the barcode app.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs backup to cloud rather than phone like Movie Collection.
FEATURE REQUEST
Search option should not be hidden in options but obvious.
FEATURE REQUEST
I initially downloaded it so that I would be able to create a portable catalogue of my library  which would help keep me from buying books I already owned.
FEATURE REQUEST
I now also use to keep track of which books I am missing  which books I have in different languages  and perhaps most importantly which books I have loaned to friends and family.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like it I like it alot but I wish you could have it look more like it was on actual bookshelves.
FEATURE REQUEST
Overall  a great app  but I wish there was an option that allowed you to list every book in an anthology under the various authors with the titles instead of just under the one title.
FEATURE REQUEST
So far I only have a few major complaints: 1) I wish you could add multiple genres  separated by a semi-colon or comma  that would sort into each genre.
FEATURE REQUEST
2) I really  really wish there was a check box for 'I own this book' I've made a separate bookshelf for that  but a check box would be so much better!
FEATURE REQUEST
If I add an Ebook for example  it might have been published electronically in 2012 but was first published in the 80s.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if the goodreads integration worked better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wishlist option Liking this app so far but would love it if you can add an option for books i want to read or buy then when i am at a book store i can just open the app and see what is on my to buy or read list this would really be nice
FEATURE REQUEST
It goes through Amazon  which is not structured well to find what is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish they had a Wish List Think it would b nice it they had a separate category & title it Wish List.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would have been nice if it worked.
FEATURE REQUEST
I am exporting my files and adding this to all my devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App Would be 5* if you cold enter books offline then search when there is a Internet/ WiFi connection.
FEATURE REQUEST
Oddly  vertical graphics are all missing but horizontal are fine.
FEATURE REQUEST
Few UI improvEments could be made  but it is still awesome
FEATURE REQUEST
The only complaint I have is it could use a new interface  seriously outdated.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very nice app for cataloging  I wish I could see other review and notes for each book and share mine though.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing I would want  is to be able to add friends  so we can see what the other is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Oh  also to be able to see what books we are missing in a series without going out of the app  to amazon (where I do buy my books  but I'd rather stay in the app and have them organized).
FEATURE REQUEST
Loved it It would be better if the backup is integrated with cloud storage.
FEATURE REQUEST
I deleted CVS app and tried to scan and app stated that i needed the z scanner.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it can access external card.
FEATURE REQUEST
Even after following directions exactly when switching phones  my books were there but the covers are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
it needs only to have the option of arranging the book list with ""book title"" as well as the other options and preference .
FEATURE REQUEST
Having fun easily adding my books via isbn  and it's been right 99% of the time.
FEATURE REQUEST
I hate having duplicates of books or being in bookstores and not knowing what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hated I originally thought it was a great app so when I got a new phone I redownloded it but low and behold my over 100 books list was gone and had to be rescanned each book then I clicked something to make sure the list was backed up and got a new phone and yet again lost it all .
FEATURE REQUEST
So I've had this app for a while and just started adding my books.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to change how to view all the books  in stead of having them all in one long list  view them as tiles to view them quicker and easier.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also a wish list idea would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Like the bookshelves  flag for books lent out and the search options for adding books.
FEATURE REQUEST
It has the best cover image options I've found  and the best search add options.
FEATURE REQUEST
This worked fine for cataloging my books  but it would be great if it had a place to show you the reading level for children's books.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs to be more flexible with scan apps thay can be used with it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It was just what I needed..until I upgraded to a new phone......this should be easy to import to new phone.....not.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I try to scan Barcode/ISBNs  sometimes it tells me that the ISBN is invalid  but when I enter the ISBN manually  the book is found.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is a near perfect program for what I needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if it could synch between multiple devices in family so when shopping you always had one database to check.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great way to track what I have and what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be cool to add e books as well  so you can keep track of what you have already got on ebook too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Have not tried it properly yet but apparently you can export and import under admin so will try and will update review accordingley.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good utility  could be great I really like this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if it would actually let you save to backup to an external sd card.
FEATURE REQUEST
A couple of features that would top this app off would be the ability to have it also show all the books in a series (for example) to make it easier for people to see what books they may be missing when trying to complete a set.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would then also need to have a check box to indicate if the book is in the library or not  and having the app automatically offer to complete the series when a book is scanned in would be grand.
FEATURE REQUEST
Plz add INDIAN LANGUAGES ALSO.
FEATURE REQUEST
An option to change the currency would be nice  also the ability to see what your collection is worth.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  a feature to search books that have been loaned is most required.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add this feature soon.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing I'd like is for something like a log in thing so my books could be saved on there.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm dreading when I have to re-add all the books again when I get a new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think that in the export options you should automatically be able to upload to something like DropBox.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really like this app I just wish it could be saved to my sd card
FEATURE REQUEST
You can add books to your library by either scanning the code  entering the ISBN  searching on the internet or even add them it manually (I love the scanning.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really like that I am able to search for books with the Author Name and the Name of the book  or a few other options for adding books.
FEATURE REQUEST
Seems ok Would be great if you could see rating / notes on My Books list screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love it except When I got this app I loved it and I still would except it recently started going to the ""Michael's"" craft store app every time I try to scan a new book.
FEATURE REQUEST
The actual library part is really good  just needs a few tweaks to make it great.
FEATURE REQUEST
So I can see immediately if some need updating.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just a request to add a field of 'Category' for books while adding them.
FEATURE REQUEST
As so many before me have noted  this app would be Perfect if I only all the data could be stored on the SD card.
FEATURE REQUEST
Am I missing it?
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing I suggest the makers add is an option for me to store everything on my SD card instead of the phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if that could be added as an option in the future.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could add my own fields.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic for book worms I purchased a different book cataloging app prior to trying this one and I wish I had saved my money!
FEATURE REQUEST
I love that I can add multiple bookshelves  too  great way to keep track of books I'm borrowing and loaning out!
FEATURE REQUEST
2: I've read that other apps have issues if you add too many books - I'm nearing 1 000 with no issues yet (Google Goggles sometimes hiccups).
FEATURE REQUEST
Con: I wanted an app that I would be able to easily lone books to my students by simply scanning the book again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there a way to add a saved class list that can be selected from when a book is loaned and returned?
FEATURE REQUEST
Any chance we could add AR level as a addition to each book?
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I needed Great app for organizing your home library.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but would like to be able to see statistics on my collection such as total worth  number of books in a genre  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if I could have been able to set a bookshelf and scan a whole lot of books pre-set to that book shelf and not have to set it each time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent just missing import Google books
FEATURE REQUEST
Being able to check if I own a particular book on my phone is fast  I can add several libraries so that I have my lace making books in their own  my fantasy/paranormal in their own too.
FEATURE REQUEST
I was able to type in the isbn and needed a wifi connection for it to find the book I was planning on using this to keep track of the audiobooks that I listen to but will be looking at other options.
FEATURE REQUEST
Did I just miss how to read my book on here?
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great to export by genre.
FEATURE REQUEST
If not that  then add genre to the export so it can be filtered via spreadsheet.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good for managing personal library Two things are missing 1.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic Wish there was a way I could donate with Play Store - I would do it immediately!
FEATURE REQUEST
Only minor gripe is that export is only in csv  not text or rtf - and my android devices don't have software to read csv files so I have to go to my PC when I want to copy & paste the list.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be cool if you could add books directly from your Google library
FEATURE REQUEST
No more buying duplicates because i can't remember I've bought the book before or trying to remember what books i still need to read.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very helpful I find this app extremely helpful  but it needs a section for notes that you can put in.
FEATURE REQUEST
Having suggestions on what books my be missing from a series would be great too.
FEATURE REQUEST
If doing a lot of scanning at once  there should be a better way of switching between scanning and manually entering ISBNs.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love this app  I needed something like this so bad.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to be able to apply the Dewey system.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it - minor tweak to make it 5/5 Love this app  but would like the ability to get a warning notification or sound when scanning duplicates  that'd help when scanning books at the bookstore.
FEATURE REQUEST
One request on edition type can you please add audiobook.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App Works great  only wish it had an option to mark if you own a particular book  or a wishlist.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you are a reader  you need to get this app!
FEATURE REQUEST
It's what I needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Dion Hardy's Bookshelf was much much better - just wish it was still available.
FEATURE REQUEST
So  would be great if the functionality to scan and add books within Amazon kindle  Google books  and other reading apps could be added.
FEATURE REQUEST
But really very very useful and really loved it Edit : Pls add a light theme.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app wish it would share more info Excellent solution for a bookworm with evernote.
FEATURE REQUEST
One suggestion is can you add eBook as one of the formats in addition to hardcover  paperback  etc?
FEATURE REQUEST
Just one thing missing The only thing I would want to add to this app is the ability to search for a book's Dewey number  or even just a field to enter one manually.
FEATURE REQUEST
My one and only request is if you could please add different background options - specifically a background that looks like an actual bookshelf.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just need one for dvds now
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  I was having problems with apps showing up on the barcode reader and they immediately let me know I just needed to download a different reader.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be very useful to inform others on like genres of books we are reading and they could go through that list to find out about those books.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it would run on my Nook.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes has a problem identifying older pre-ISBN books  so I'll need to manually add some of them.
FEATURE REQUEST
To anyone complaining about lack of cloud synch or automatic off phone backup  copy the backup file to dropbox or Google drive like you are prompted to by the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I've tried the scholastic app that is similar to this  but they were missing several of their own books on it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I also like that you can add multiple copies of the same book to the library on the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great I had a lot of trouble at first but then I figured it out but I think it needs more of how to use it manual.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it was on PC.
FEATURE REQUEST
It does all what I need and it does it at the best.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you have more than 5 books you need this program!
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish that instead of backing up/saving to the sd card (or phone since mine doesn't have sd)  it could back up/sync with Google drive or something like that.
FEATURE REQUEST
If I add buy searching by author  it should give me a list of works by that author rather than giving me a title to select our not.
FEATURE REQUEST
I've tried others This has most of what I need and does that well.
FEATURE REQUEST
I was able to import quite a few books effortlessly by adding my amazon purchase history via goodreads.
FEATURE REQUEST
I could of course import manually image files for the covers or snap a picture  but it sounds like a waste of time given the api in theory would allow to import them all (unless there are licensing issues with some ?)
FEATURE REQUEST
Option required I would love the option to track what I loan out (persons name and info) with a reminder when I start the app if the loan period was up.
FEATURE REQUEST
surprised and disappointed in lack of wishlist.
FEATURE REQUEST
More LibraryThing connectivity like being able to upload my collection info would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish i had discovered this earlier!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but needs work.
FEATURE REQUEST
The look and feel of the interface needs to be improved too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love this app Easy to use and add books.very useful to me cos I love books and I can't always remember them all.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everything I need  satisfaction is beyond words.
FEATURE REQUEST
My mom and I both go book shopping and it would be nice to easily sync the data between the two phones so we don't buy duplicate books.
FEATURE REQUEST
App seems like it would be useful  but the barcode scanner function doesn't seem to work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Am I missing something?
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish there was a cover option for when there are multiple covers for the same book.
FEATURE REQUEST
plus with the AISN I can add my Kindle books as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I find myself wishing it would do one more thing  I wish it could tell me how much all of my books total are worth.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love this app  it would be really cool if you could hit a button to see how much you've spent on books in your bookshelves based on the list price.
FEATURE REQUEST
As well  if its a series of book  the total number of books within the series right next to its name  as to help tracking how many we are missing in that series.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would had the last star if both those things could be added.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but still buggy I have so many books that this is perfect for what I need but the last so many months  when I scan or input the ISBN number  it gets hung up sometimes for quite a while.
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect for what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's super easy to load in books with the ISBN scanner  and if you're obsessive like me you can even add call numbers in the ""location"" field (you do have to track them down yourself  but most books have the number printed on the copyright page).
FEATURE REQUEST
No longer do I have to wonder if (or where) I have a particular book!
FEATURE REQUEST
Far too many features and functions to list them all  but adding  sorting  customisation are extensive  well designed and easy to use.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome Ive tried about 10 different apps and come back to this one it keeps all my books listed in correct order even if i dont scan them that way the scanner could be a little better but still awesome and simple
FEATURE REQUEST
Only wish I could figure out how to delete multiple variations of an author's name.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app has that data available whenever I add a new book  but I can't organize my list by it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just a suggestion  it would make it easier to know which series I need to finish when there's a sale going on.
FEATURE REQUEST
There's an option to export the data of your books  in case you need all your information on your computer.
FEATURE REQUEST
One thing I would mention  once you put a book to one bookshelf  I don't think that there is an easy way of moving it to an other bookshelf in the app like scanning it on another bookshelf.
FEATURE REQUEST
It supports a few scanner apps  from which google googles is the best  but I'd be happier if i-nigma was supported as it's very fast  or if I could add books by importing the ISBNs.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App but needs some major modifications I admit that this is one app that I have been searching for.
FEATURE REQUEST
A nice option would be variables for audio books.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love what this app offers for detail about the books and I love that I can edit and add more info  and track what I've read.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hey mister Mister  we need more Lemon pledge.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs design improvement for easier operation & the ability to sync with other OS / devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Badly needs Material Design!
FEATURE REQUEST
Only wish their was finger print support
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic  feature rich password manager Would be great if support for fingerprint readers was added as a second form of authentication.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it was in material design.
FEATURE REQUEST
Split screen capabilities would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
When you first open a file from drive it works fine but when you try to open it again by tapping on the recent file entry it does nothing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing features such as quick unlock.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be good to advice this security issue when the app is installed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to edit group names.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's a basic housekeeping function which should be included.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be good to have a simpler way of accessing the DB.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not sure if I'm missing something
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost unusable There is no way to manage groups except create ones (neither move/rename nor delete).
FEATURE REQUEST
No longer saves new entries I have used this app for years  but i just tried adding a new entry and i got the error ""failed to save database"".
FEATURE REQUEST
Features that would be nice(and hold back from 5 stars) include icon setting and expiration.
FEATURE REQUEST
Autotype we need autotypefunction like windows version
FEATURE REQUEST
Suggestion of adding the username column It is the geat app  and therefore I give 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only one suggestion  wish it was possible to use a NFC key with OTP such as Yubikey to unlock rather using a key file or maybe in conjunction with the master password.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty good  but lacking It completely lacks the ability to change the icon for entries  and partially lacks the ability to change icons for groups  meaning you can change it as you make it  but not afterwards.
FEATURE REQUEST
Once you get past the learning curve this app does almost everything you'll need it to do.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's Open Source and it allows one to randomize all their passwords and access them in one place without ever needing to know more than one password.
FEATURE REQUEST
Recomendation: In the future  might consider adding the ""generate secure password"" feature  since almost any phone now a day can handle good values of entropy and generate decent robust passwords
FEATURE REQUEST
Only complaint: it would be nice to have Material Design interface.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everyone should have this
FEATURE REQUEST
Lean but outdated Please add autofill functions while maintaining the minimalism.
FEATURE REQUEST
An interface update would be nice too ;)
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to have a warning or notification when choosing a keyfile that won't fit in the phones memory.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everyone should have KeePass to secure their passwords and other critical information.
FEATURE REQUEST
And if you have an Android device  you need to get KeePassDroid too.
FEATURE REQUEST
After all  you probably need that critical information with you throughout the day.
FEATURE REQUEST
KeePass + KeePassDroid along with Dropbox or some other Cloud storage will keep your passwords as secure as possible  but available when you need them.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only wish it were sexyier!
FEATURE REQUEST
#1 app for password management No need to say more
FEATURE REQUEST
WISH THEY COULD DEVELOP A SIMILAR APP FOR CHROMEBOOKS.
FEATURE REQUEST
KeePassDroid needs an update to the intent filters in its manifest to support the new format.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding support for the Nexus Imprint will be fantastic.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best Mobile KeePass Thanks for adding Android N support and Google Drive integration!
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing google drive support  switched to keepass2android for working cloud storage support
FEATURE REQUEST
Well  thankfully I could use Android Picker to select the file through some of the file managers I use.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs some additional features like moving an account from one top cover to another  etc
FEATURE REQUEST
If the OI File Manager is required to browse for files in Keepass  then why isn't it installed automatically  or better yet  design Keepass so it isn't necessary?
FEATURE REQUEST
Works as expected  could look better This app could use a facelift.
FEATURE REQUEST
nice but missing update changelog been using keepass for years and was delighted to find an android port some while ago!
FEATURE REQUEST
Working again after update Love the app but need the previous version as the new one does not run on my Note II.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to fix immediately
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing is finger print unlocking like iOS version.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is greyed out and the only way is to download the file which means it doesn't sync.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if you add fingerprint login
FEATURE REQUEST
I suspect this is due to a change in how Drive opens files  but that the fix needs to be on this side (I believe keepassdroid doesn't handle a *.kdbx intent??)
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be amazing if it could add nexus imprint support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Attachments are missing It is not showing attached files.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add new icons Please add some new relevant icons.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but please add support for fingerprint on Marshmallow
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but needs few tweaks Would be great if app moved to background after copying password
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect Password Manager I've been using this app for over 5 years now  & the PC version for over 15yrs - it works perfectly & I have my passwords available to me EVERYWHERE I need them - Thank You
FEATURE REQUEST
straight forward  does what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
A Material Design UI would be nice  but is certainly not necessary  and the other benefits of a solid KeePass Android port definitely outweigh this one fault.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need a better-looking icon and UI
FEATURE REQUEST
Fingerprint unlock on Android Great app though needs the fingerprint unlock functionality that is available in the equivalent iOS app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good  but no read/write access Would love the option to edit  not just access as Read Only.
FEATURE REQUEST
It could have an auto sync function with cloud services.
FEATURE REQUEST
A Required Program I have over a hundred strong passwords that I need to keep track of.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if fingerprint scanner support (nexus imprint) was added and I agree it could use a ui overhaul
FEATURE REQUEST
Quite good Just add fingerprint support for 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
Stable and usable but not perfect I only lack of two features: to be able to input password without copying it (it stays in the clipboard) and to save password history as in original KeePassX linux application.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love having all of my passwords accessible and in one place when I need them!
FEATURE REQUEST
Improvement request I would like to be able to associate othr file extensions eith the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to support clouds like mega
FEATURE REQUEST
Asks for updates App must be updated with autofill.
FEATURE REQUEST
After creating a group there is no way to edit its name if I want to rename a group.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only wish that devs took a look at UI.
FEATURE REQUEST
you need x20+ different sentences or items to fill up the clipboard or get some app but test it actually clears the clipboard because the popular one I tested did not.
FEATURE REQUEST
Problem was solved by moving the database onto the phones internal storage and then I could add and edit entries again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to get it working when storing the database on external micro sd cards.
FEATURE REQUEST
Foundation tool Everyone should use some type of password manager.
FEATURE REQUEST
Stripped version of desktop application Needs more abilities and redesign.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't care about the UI; I think it's fine but lack of Google Drive support prevents the app from being a 5 star app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could give it six stars!
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish there was a save state for beginners like me.
FEATURE REQUEST
However my one gripe is I seem to have trouble finding enough strength potions for the weapons and armor  since it is the prerequisite for better gear you need the str level to use them.
FEATURE REQUEST
The game is really fun only problem is there are some parts that don't seem fair like a skeleton killing me by dying how was I supposed to know that would happen so being able to restart on the floor you died on would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fixing this  if a bug  or reverting this  if intentional  would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Although I would NOT say they add content ""roughly"" every month  they are starting to catch up to ""Sprouted"" PD.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love for the dew system from ""Sprouted"" PD to come to this version  then it would be better!
FEATURE REQUEST
i wish skillful continued updating as Well.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a better balance of items (especially for melee characters.)
FEATURE REQUEST
I get that there needs to be a payment for almost dying and triggering the berserker mode  however I'm level 23 and recovering from it won't work because I can't get the required 3 levels  since you just stop leveling at some point and potions of experience are nigh nonexistent.
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for the good times Here's a protip...spam health potions on the last fight (make sure you get enough...buy them too) and ignore the last 5 floors they are too hard.i beat the game myself as the best class (warrior of course) and I seriously think you should get it
FEATURE REQUEST
I've been stuck on the 3rd boss for months now and i'm considering uninstalling due to the lack of help on how to fight it.
FEATURE REQUEST
You just need more patience in the lower levels...it'll all work out in the end.
FEATURE REQUEST
I sometimes wish I could play various versions of Shattered as the tweaks alter the gameplay in different and novel ways.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish that the book of mastery would be available on characters that have defeated the tengu on start of game.
FEATURE REQUEST
And how about adding a few more floors  enemys and scrolls/ potions.
FEATURE REQUEST
What I do find ironic though  is whatever class you play  anything that would be useful to that class does not drop.
FEATURE REQUEST
Beautifully created game If you rated one star because of bugs stop ruining the rating and if you can't get past the first boss then you just need to git gud.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's All Happening + need the ability to change the color of the equipment rename to whatever hue we chose + add more characters to unlock  each with their own two subclasses.
FEATURE REQUEST
(Grade A idea) + add more enemies  randomized variants of the base NPC's.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing I'm missing is some sort of progression as in a rogue-lite.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could roll back to 0.4
FEATURE REQUEST
Just suggestions no need to follow them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Although it lacking in something like a 'monster archives' or at least a place that record all the weapons/items appear in the game.
FEATURE REQUEST
Armor I'm improvements If you can add an armor upgrade scroll and a weapon upgrade scroll that will be awesome.
FEATURE REQUEST
Loved it I like how they are fighting skill the classes and items.I think you should add some follower that can help you or add classes call summoner.He has skill to summon skeleton.
FEATURE REQUEST
One minor minor bug but phenomenal game The game is amazing (still can't make it past level 17 no matter how hard I try) just want to say the developer is great this is the best of the pixel dungeon knock offs  the minor bug is that when you fall into the level below and it sometimes occurs on top of a monster making u have to step away from it get hit then proceed to attack it  like I said minor minor  but it would be nice if you killed it on impact.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game just needs rebalancing The warrior and wizard class have become considerably worse and make the game too challenging however this can be fixed by returning the shortsword for warrior and giving the wizard faster wand recharge times and/or by lowering weapons and armor strength requirement or by inserting year that is in between those huge gaps
FEATURE REQUEST
The artifacts in particular add a whole level of intrigue and replay-ability that the old one lacked.
FEATURE REQUEST
Way to ruin a game Was fun  new updates neuter the warrior class and add so many variables it is no longer a simple or fun game.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome game Could the next update add something where the Mimic changes into other stuff other than an chest?
FEATURE REQUEST
RIP Mastery Tomb Shatter pixel dungeon used to be the best pixel dungeon until you got rid of the mastery tomb that you can use in every start of a game once it's unlocked.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  now I think I should uninstall and remove this now falling downhill app from my game.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like the option to remove the updates  use prior versions  or have all the nonsense removed.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish they could put the warrior back to its original style but it's fine.
FEATURE REQUEST
Among other things  it is confusing since there is no way to know if an upgrade will reduce the str req or not.
FEATURE REQUEST
Gladiator isn't useful The gladiator sucks if you have a fast hitting low damage weapon I'm using the sai weapons and I hit 3 times per turn if I miss 2 times the combo is lost but I can move 3 turns before it's lost its annoying that it's so hard to get a combo up because just missing 2 times it's all gone and even with a combo it's not worth it when I have the 10 combo ability the most it hits is 2 or 3 and every other time it does no damage at all a lot of the time using the 10 combo ability does less than just hitting them
FEATURE REQUEST
By then  there might be a bugfix release  so that might not be necessary.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to be able to change background and text colors but it hasn't bothered me.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app If only it can run adrift file  I'll give 6 star.
FEATURE REQUEST
More customization would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Images Great app  would be great if images were supported!
FEATURE REQUEST
I'll have to keep looking for a port knocker that will work over 3G  4G etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome Would be great to be able to specify the contents of the packet though  I wanna send my own udp message!
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice interface but lacks file open & save Better  lack while loading file and saving it
FEATURE REQUEST
It's good....needs improvement Hey  this app is a good application for making fast presentations on the go.....but I was not able to cast it on to a screen or a projector....this was not helpful......please add the cast to screen function to make it a much better app.
FEATURE REQUEST
As others have commented  it lacks some key features; for me  the buzz-kill is the inability to add comments.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good one To become the best you must add moves statistics and opening report as in SCID vs pc
FEATURE REQUEST
would be better to have a button on the main display to quickly start/stop engine in game review mode and game study mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also option in setting to show arrow on display for engine move when analysing would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Prasad Really nice  how can I add new engines  plz tell me
FEATURE REQUEST
Only it should use arrows for best moves in analyze mode like droidfish.
FEATURE REQUEST
And board search should have option to search only one side(white or black) piece positions.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please make it possible to add comments to the moves and save it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Brilliant Only wish study mode would also choose variations  not only mainline.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also would be great if you could play the entire database  and not just one game.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be so much better if review and analysis modes where merged; and the engine on/off put on a toggle on the top line.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there a way I can integrate them into one?
FEATURE REQUEST
Great to look at games Wish it would have better game list navigation.
FEATURE REQUEST
A core classic must have app for chess nuts  if you could pick only two android chess apps this would be one  maybe DROIDFISH would be the other or Chess for Android  or maybe the ""CVNCS"" Chess app with it's twenty thousand (or 34 000 or whatever it is) puzzles for free  but if you had to pick just ONE  it must be this one  you could put a huge db file of puzzles  mate in 1 or 2 or 3  or tactics and use the Study mode to see if you can guess them.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have one minor request: could we add the feature to use the volume keys as forward/backward buttons while reading a game?
FEATURE REQUEST
Nitpicks: search heuristics can be improved  & would like to see Wikipedia_en_all dumps more often than 1-2 times per year.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make update for contents?
FEATURE REQUEST
I have to repeat the whole syllable in searching again something  I think there should be an arrow like option beside the search suggestion list in search box.
FEATURE REQUEST
I no longer need to manually use the ""split -b 4000m"" command.
FEATURE REQUEST
Gets the job done 64 Gb card is necessary for full download of Wikipedia.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you download via http  you will also likely have to change your browser's default download location to the SD card  which is WAY harder to do than it should be.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best app Need to improve search.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there any way to export your bookmarks to a new phone though?
FEATURE REQUEST
I am a student studying in school.I need more information for project of everything.This app has solved my problems of getting information without internet or Wi-Fi at home as well as in my traveling time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome You should keep the zim files updated till date
FEATURE REQUEST
There is only the missing corrections
FEATURE REQUEST
As such  you would think that the app would give you the ability to select a .zim file to load  but the app completely lacks any file selection dialog.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need improve Nice app for rule belong people but need improve plz
FEATURE REQUEST
Or It will be good changing article language directly in the article instead of opening another zim file and do everything again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Neat app It is simple to set up but if you change your mind about what file you want to download / use it is hard to figure out how to download a new file.
FEATURE REQUEST
It need wifi bro
FEATURE REQUEST
Everyone should have a world of knowledge in their pocket.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I had more storage space on my phone so that I could download more articles!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it handled filed switching better  but they've replied that they want to do that soon in another review.
FEATURE REQUEST
Never download this app We have to download so much whole Internet means so much more than 5gb its good so much we have to download
FEATURE REQUEST
Hassan khan yes' I have access internet' but Wikipedia app can't work offline often need to be safe pages offline than I found kiwix I want to you make it online and offline thanks.
FEATURE REQUEST
would be nice to have an exit button like before or long-press the back button?
FEATURE REQUEST
With it and some offline dictionaries I no longer need to use the Internet to do my projects  especially at a time when the 3G/4G Internet is still expensive and unreliable!
FEATURE REQUEST
This is great This a great product from these fine people and I hope that they do more good to try to spread information to the people who need it the most
FEATURE REQUEST
If you use wikipedia then you should have kiwix.
FEATURE REQUEST
Plus suggest me how can I open.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs lots of improvement For now the app lacks so many features  as it's released recently i hope much improvement will take place over time.
FEATURE REQUEST
For the full English Wikipedia  you need a 64GB SD card (nearly full).
FEATURE REQUEST
To include the index you need something a bit larger (next one up is 128 GB).
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Search capabilities could be improved  however.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but missing few things!
FEATURE REQUEST
You should add a QUIT option to the menu by the way ;)
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to add exit button.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm not sure if you can download all the English articles only but that'd be great if you could.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add option of installing on SD card
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add it in next update
FEATURE REQUEST
The Great app for common man who lack network connection.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to have the iOS version too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Devs you can add cloud storage support (Google Drive etc) to automatically export/import accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great free game suite Good thing to install to any fresh android phone  just in case you are bored or need to entertain a kid  or an adult.
FEATURE REQUEST
All the puzzles you need A purely divine app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some of the features from OpenSudoku would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
controls for 'intertia' could be improved or embiggined.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be more apps like this!
FEATURE REQUEST
Stellar app The customizability  ease of use  lack of ads  multitude of games  and randomly generated puzzles makes this the best app  by far  for any puzzler.
FEATURE REQUEST
I do wish it had more difficulty levels for some of the puzzles though
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could give it more stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see a hint button sometimes.
FEATURE REQUEST
But is there a way to make the error markings (mostly in red) optional so you could turn it on/off during a game?
FEATURE REQUEST
Only thing that could be improved is the look.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only game you need I have played this game for years!
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect I honestly love it  the variety is awesome  and it being ACTUALLY free makes me feel happy that the creators of this app just like fun puzzle games and think that that should be all there is to it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish more companies worked like this one does.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ironically  that makes it one of the few apps I wish I could shovel money at.
FEATURE REQUEST
The developer(s) should be elevated to sainthood.
FEATURE REQUEST
Misses simple interactive tutorials not involving reading lengthy texts.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish more developers would make apps like this.
FEATURE REQUEST
One suggestion I would like more options for controls.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic Wish I'd found this earlier.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only app you'll ever need to fill down time
FEATURE REQUEST
Would like to see a ""show mistakes"" button for when you don't want to reveal the whole solution  just see if you've made a mistake yet
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it would tell you how to play.
FEATURE REQUEST
If I could suggest another puzzle  it would be great if it had kakuro.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to make more puzzles.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only wish there were statistics of win rates
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was an expansion
FEATURE REQUEST
it dose what i need it dose everything but planeschase
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Love and use quite often.
FEATURE REQUEST
I will give 5 stars if you add this
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish they would finally incorporate tiny leader info
FEATURE REQUEST
This one is a small thing but I feel like it would be nice  when selecting ""view card"" from my wish list  I'd like to see the card as printed in the set I've selected instead of a default card.
FEATURE REQUEST
Bit of a request Could you guys possibly add a way to search by the water mark?
FEATURE REQUEST
On a more recent change  though I really am hoping they can add a price option for ""Market Price"" from TCG.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is absolutely the best  it has everything from trade (most useful  right off TCG) and life die and mana counters  all it needs to be even better is tokens
FEATURE REQUEST
And also adding a deck builder would be neat.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if you could exclude search terms and search for specific mana symbols and "":"" in the text field.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome Fantastic app...just needs the option to enter your deck and save it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's a pretty fantastic app  but the general lack of Promo and Prerelease cards makes some trades hard to do (even if they're listed on TCGplayer.)
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe you could add a deckbuilding feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love if you could integrate a deck builder.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but improvement please So I love it but if you could have a simple deck building tool that be wonderful I use this app for everything but have a separate almost exact app just slow to the updates for standard please add a deck builder.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had starcitygames prices also.
FEATURE REQUEST
I use it for deckbuilding and as assistance when I judge and a complicated stack comes up and I need to figure out proper resolving!
FEATURE REQUEST
You need this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
can you add something like that?
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice App Love this app  so usefull  but needs an update for the ""From the Vault: Lore"" content!
FEATURE REQUEST
Now it would be nice if I could turn off the auto-dimming on the life counter?
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to see that small issue fixed but otherwise i love the app
FEATURE REQUEST
The card trader party was missing cards like other versions of Jace (only Beleren appears) but other than that it had what it should.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love it buuuuuut I needed to make room for Pok茅mon go.
FEATURE REQUEST
Satisfied in the past This app has done me well in the past  but lately it has needed to grow.
FEATURE REQUEST
Secondly they need to have an option to price by tcg ""market price"" with the recent changes to help keep the market honest this app has fallen behind.
FEATURE REQUEST
Every MtG player  whether professional or beginner  should have this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Request Could you please add magic duels to the Format section?
FEATURE REQUEST
BEST MTG APP ON THE MARKET Every magic player should have this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love it I love this it's very helpful and i can find what i need i give this 5 stars!!!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
I love the addition of color identity filtering  however  I think there should be an option for ""Not any of these color(s).""
FEATURE REQUEST
Foil issue In the trade cards window entering foils and adding them to the trade doesn't register the foil option.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is a good app with plenty of useful features  but I really wish it had decklist building support.
FEATURE REQUEST
It has a wish list feature  but I really wish there were support for multiple named lists of cards  ideally with analyzation tools and whatnot (similar to tappedout)  but even just lists would be fine.
FEATURE REQUEST
Feature request It'd be cool to have an option to build decks and get deck statistics.
FEATURE REQUEST
All it needs now is a deck building option and it would be the only MTG app I would use
FEATURE REQUEST
This app does 99% of everything any player could possibly need to do.
FEATURE REQUEST
But there needs to be a way to search cards by color identity  not just color.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only feel it's lacking one thing and that's searching for cards with a Mana cost with ""X"" in them
FEATURE REQUEST
Useful but lacking functionality I really like this application but when it comes to trading it's a bit lacking  would be better if you could check prices set by SCG as that is the norm for a lot of trades  also some issues finding foil value and saving a list of all tour cards
FEATURE REQUEST
White colorized names Would be nice if white was not a possible color for names to be colorized with.
FEATURE REQUEST
Limited customization Needs more features like color control and font choice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be good if I got to choose the font.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to also be able to set the alert option per room or from specific senders instead of globally.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would have rated much higher if not for several nuances that I wish it had.
FEATURE REQUEST
A button for nick auto-completion  like AndChat has  would be good.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  a minor thing  but I should still be able to /join channels  despite there being a button to do this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some /list functionality would be great; right now  this command crashes the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing is start at boot and autoconnect.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing custom highlight Would like custom highlight notifications
FEATURE REQUEST
I stopped using this app because of that (and the lack of / commands support).
FEATURE REQUEST
hard to evaluate this works reliably enough for what it CAN do  but functionality wise it's incapable of doing what I actually need it for.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only thing I wish it had was the ability to automatically select from among multiple servers and ports (mainly because some FreeNode servers don't work on my employer's firewalled WiFi network).
FEATURE REQUEST
Good client otherwise just needs some final brushing at this point.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Features This would be the best irc client for android if it wasn't missing so many features.
FEATURE REQUEST
How about adding a whois script.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls add support for svgz
FEATURE REQUEST
We need more functions  such as export to .jpg files etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could have better integration From the file manager it works  but from the Downloads app it doesn't  nor from gmail attachments.
FEATURE REQUEST
Useless Lacks any kind of integration / file load system.
FEATURE REQUEST
You shouldn't be forced to donate  especially without being able to at least try the app first.
FEATURE REQUEST
Deceptive I don't mind paying for an app  but to pop up a screen asking for a buck (with no way to bypass it) before you can use a ""free"" app is wrong.
FEATURE REQUEST
Exactly what I wanted Was limited to opening HTML documents in Android's HTML viewer (which lacks internet permissions).
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if it could tell if a permission is denied for an app  and sort by the score based off only granted permissions.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would also be cool if for each app it gave a shortcut to its app information page in system settings  IIRC that can be done without root  and it seems odd that there's no button or link for that
FEATURE REQUEST
It didn't rate all my apps (missed WhatsApp for ex) and sometimes gave inconsistent scores - bad score but when looking at the details it said it was ok).
FEATURE REQUEST
Very Useful App A very good app  but the results need to be interpreted with care.
FEATURE REQUEST
For instance  the Lookout security app has a very high score because it needs access to almost everything.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also most developers want to know how you use their apps - for analytical purposes so they can improve them  so this generally means network access is required.
FEATURE REQUEST
in the next update we hope the developer add a list of safe apps in different categories .
FEATURE REQUEST
would be nice if this app would allow an access button to go-ogle play apps to get app info  then rate it  before one deletes it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think go-ogle is now requiring developers to insert totally unnecessary permissions unbeknownst to users--why some apps need to open camera  read SD cards  view contacts  etc is way beyond an app's basic usage.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs 2 things Needs to fix resizing for horizontal view and needs you to allow modification of permissions from the app itself.
FEATURE REQUEST
However if you do have marshmallow it is necessary to distinguish between granted and blocked permissions.
FEATURE REQUEST
And changing permissions directly from this app would be nice too.
FEATURE REQUEST
i only wish that you had a paid version to change the permissions(if rooted) like app ops
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing useful features.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to list ALL privacy exposures for an app (including ad libraries) & display a list of installed apps that have above average exposure for their app category.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would have been even better if this app could give us options to revoke permissions as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app too bad about the rest of my apps I was unimpressed to find the apps that I had already downloaded because they needed no special permissions......had special permissions attached to them somehow.
FEATURE REQUEST
But i needed to keep some of the apps  which didn't ask for any of my permission.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's missing some basic features: 1) to be able to add more than one folder in the library at the same time (unacceptable) and generally more sorting options 2)cropping option for the page borders.
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect; needs synced Only one thing needed to make this perfect.
FEATURE REQUEST
if there is any possibility please include vertical scrolling this feature will be nice to have.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love a feature that shows if the message has been delivered and read  but that is low on the list of priorities I had for a secure messaging app  surespot checked all the boxes except that one!
FEATURE REQUEST
needs to support more archive formats everything is fine except it doesn't support all of the archiving formats
FEATURE REQUEST
Everything great  but needs option to share files within same network Then this will be on all 8 of my devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd have one request though: I'd like to be able to open files stored on a remote sftp server with any app I want (VLC for instance).
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there were more open source apps like this for android
FEATURE REQUEST
web etm I need soft suppot my star finder
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could donate but I don't have a credit card.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what you need!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great If you could add support for comment reactions (thumbs up  etc) that would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Why is there no logout option?
FEATURE REQUEST
A lot of feature missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
You know what would be really cool?
FEATURE REQUEST
the last update was april  it needs updates.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs an update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Browser  needs an update Update: This browser is crashing more and more and more.
FEATURE REQUEST
But like others have mentioned it needs better tab management - needs open tabs in background  incognito tabs disappear sometimes and can't get back into them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Was good  but lack of updates killed it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add web filter There are website I want blocked and can you add a id safe search engine into the list
FEATURE REQUEST
This all needs to be reworked.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need background tabs.
FEATURE REQUEST
And I need to manage my tabs (close AND open)  without being dragged out of the menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
At first I thought it wasn't working after I turned it on and then I realized I needed to restart the browser.
FEATURE REQUEST
It just needs some more features to get five stars  like opening links in background tabs and syncing bookmarks to Dropbox or better yet a service like pinboard.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish list Wish I could sort my book marks into folders or sort by subject.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way to get rid of the black screen is close all tabs.
FEATURE REQUEST
Bug Browser opens preset page in tab but when opening link from email it only opens that first tab & you need to hit the link a second time to open it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only thing keeping it from being perfect is the lack of Google sync support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  it would be great to allow users to use the old behavior when opening new tabs; open in the background.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also pls add the option to open new tabs in the background.
FEATURE REQUEST
On old version this was possible and it would be nice if there's an option to bring it back like I described in this new one.
FEATURE REQUEST
I am sure these features disappeared with an update but I need them back.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was an option to send it into the back so I can keep browsing the current tab.
FEATURE REQUEST
best browser Please add more text sizes and ability to provide alternative ad blocking rules like ruadlist.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to see a new icon  and the ability to add a bookmark as a shortcut onto the phones home page.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it Wish it had read later feature
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but the UI could be a little better Is there a material design update in the works by any chance?
FEATURE REQUEST
The app looks pretty good but I think it could use a little UI tweaking
FEATURE REQUEST
My only gripe is the lack of zoom facility for some websites such as Facebook.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like that it doesn't need any extra permissions than the ones needed to actually work.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to see a feature to add a Mozilla account in the near future and perhaps a quick ""Desktop view"" button in the dropdown menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
I bought this app for $1.50 hoping that ut would let me view sites that needs a flash player  but I was disappointed that I can't enable the setting for flash player.
FEATURE REQUEST
If the app loads a list of servers to which it blocks  it would be nice if you could add your own to that list.
FEATURE REQUEST
So running it on powerful phones is the only way to go but that defeats its purpose because those phones can also run browsers with far more functionality.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also missing a home button.
FEATURE REQUEST
*Please read* Needs a few additions to make it as good as the top browsers: 1) In the searchbox  put a button to clear everything inside it at once  I hate having to manually delete long URLs.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pull down to refresh would be nice to have and a confirmation popup when a bookmark is added.
FEATURE REQUEST
I've seen a lot of apps get ruined because the developers don't know when to stop adding feature after feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please consider adding following features Night mode  Pull to refresh  scroll to top and bottom  better font size control.
FEATURE REQUEST
But guys  PLEASE add an option to rearrange bookmarks in sidebar.
FEATURE REQUEST
beware there are rip-offs that just add ads.
FEATURE REQUEST
Has one of the better implementations of reverse rendering  but it would be nice if this feature could be toggled without having too access a preference sub-menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
It will be amazing update..please add multi window features I don't want to use chrome again
FEATURE REQUEST
UPDATE: Emailed developer regarding lack of home screen shortcut option (no response).
FEATURE REQUEST
interface should be improved
FEATURE REQUEST
Not sure why it needs the In App purchases permission though.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm missing somenthing?
FEATURE REQUEST
It is necessary to update it manually.
FEATURE REQUEST
Improvement It would be great if it also showed the ""reminders"" from the google calendar or inbox by google
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but date is hard to read I would like the option to have the date within the lines  not outside and above
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty good I'd like to see them add a weather notification/display.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what i needed Simple and highly customisable.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish you guys could implement this feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Great add on when you need to show different calendars
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome but room for improvement I love that it shows consecutive days even noon event days  my stock widget didn't do that...the one thing that would make it better is to allow for day/date text color change on days with events  to make 'at a glance' so much easier.....please look into that option...also the horizontal line placement combines the event with the following date making it rather confusing  those lines should be modified and the current date don't bigger or bold
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be better if the calender go to current date each time using the apps regardless the date last viewed when exited
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be awesome if you could add a day counter at the end of the event entry so that you would know the days left (it could be with a different font  colour and / or size and it could also be at the beginning of the event entry - left or right).
FEATURE REQUEST
Exactly what I needed Excellent app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I do wish that I could change the size of the header text  but that's a minor nitpick.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it worked on Marshmellow But it doesn't.
FEATURE REQUEST
In a future release can add the ability to increase the text size of the Date so it's more pronounced from the daily events
FEATURE REQUEST
Really good but it's not auto updating The only issue I have with this application is the lack of automatic update settings.
FEATURE REQUEST
This needs to show tasks for the day though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Got a widget that i love Took me awhile but this app is doing what i need  my schedule for the week in perfect text size and i can customize:)
FEATURE REQUEST
Light  private and intuitive Very user friendly widget  it access only on resource which it needs  the calendar.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to have a separate outlook calender widget to see updates instead of having it all in one place
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be nice to have a bit more layout customization  but one can't complain for what is an excellent freebie.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is exactly what I was missing on Galaxy S.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sync Need easier way to push sync.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need the contrasting colors for my brain to comprehend the different events that are happening throughout the week.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there any way to allow users to choose what color each event shows up as?
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect for the missing Samsung agenda calendar widget thing!
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect Would like to see option to have widget display day of week for today/tomorrow instead of today/tomorrow.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to be reminded of the day  not whether it is today.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent Exactly what I need to replace default widget  which do not have month view.
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect widget for next events  just lacks reminders This is the best widget for a vertical list of next events.
FEATURE REQUEST
Oh  and I'd suggest changing the icon  it's quite ugly  haha  it doesn't match the actual design.
FEATURE REQUEST
Like it I've been looking for calendar widget  and this is what I need  but it will be good if you can add widget for lock screen
FEATURE REQUEST
Before it only took up one line  yet I could still scroll if needed to see other items.
FEATURE REQUEST
I had to go back to the ugly Google widget so nothing was missed on my agenda.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still  it would be great if it was updated to support reminders.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could use smaller don't with custom spacing.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like this app for the widget  though I feel that something is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Exactly what I needed I'm having to block time for absolutely everything these days  and this widget has the day agenda format I desperately need to stay on track.
FEATURE REQUEST
Calendar widget One request  it would be great if there is an option to remove calendar color before the events.
FEATURE REQUEST
Should add lock timezone鈥?only important feature it lacks Displays info without loosing space鈥?set size to very small  and resized the widget for a portrait aspec (use it besides GTask to view events+tasks on same main desktop)  and it's simply perfect鈥?without having to install a new entirely calendar system like business calendar with many fundamental and simple features missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Calendar Widget It would be nice to add in the setting when you open the widget  you can decide on which should be displayed first.
FEATURE REQUEST
Recommendations 1)All day event's color should be adjustable 2)there should be some predefined templates for the colors
FEATURE REQUEST
Best calendar widget on Google Play One suggestion: would love an option to hide the icon in my app drawer.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was a bar at the top for the full current date in a 2x2 format.
FEATURE REQUEST
I REALLY wish there was a way to edit the color coding for (corporate) email.
FEATURE REQUEST
Better than my missing Widget!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love an option to set transparency level for widget background
FEATURE REQUEST
and whenever I add new tasks or events   they are not shown automatically.I add one more star for a refresh button.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Widget Would love it if the event dates  times and location colors could be set similar to event headers.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just a single suggestion to make it a ""six-star"": would be a blast if today's events could be differently colored so as to stand out from future days' events.
FEATURE REQUEST
The App is excellent but would love to also see my Reminders on the widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is perfected simplicity It does exactly what I need it to do.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need widgets to show different calenders It's nice but I need to set different calenders to different widgets not all show the same thing
FEATURE REQUEST
Currently I'm stuck at red  and the only way I can tell to change that is alter the order you add calendars  but even then the colors that are showing up on the Calendars section are pretty unappealing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Tasks I like this app just wish it would include any tasks you have on your calendar.
FEATURE REQUEST
But today it cost me $50 in missed appointment fees because it CHANGED THE TIME of my appointments after the Daylight Savings Time time change this Sunday.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could easily have 5 stars Only thing that it lacks is the ability to change color and transparency of the appointment date.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app Please add support for reminders.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great calendar app...but wish it would sync Looks great and very functional except my refresh button no longer works.
FEATURE REQUEST
If I input something in Outlook on my desktop  I have to open S Planner to sync before the calendar widget will show me everything.
FEATURE REQUEST
but it really needs to catch up with the times.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is missing an essential function however!
FEATURE REQUEST
Reminders - Missing So far the most appealing and customizable calender widget I found.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really like the widget and features but thought I'd suggest a setting for selecting the desired view of the calendar when you tap on the widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
At that point any events I add get a reminder automatically put on them.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs to stop  if I want an alarm on an event  I know how to add one (especially with so much practice of removing)
FEATURE REQUEST
Google remainders not available Otherwise great and no need to worry about privacy since permissions quite conservative
FEATURE REQUEST
Really well done  but needs additional options Really needs ability to configure day  date formats.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great calendaring Please consider adding calendar reminders.
FEATURE REQUEST
love the app however needs more customization like changing colour of dates/events also bold fonts.
FEATURE REQUEST
But PLEASE add the ability to sync my google tasks.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish you could have different calendars on different widgets!
FEATURE REQUEST
Colors Maybe you could provide options for event day to have more color options?
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect way to see the calendar in a detailed but convenient way It functions perfectly  the customization is nice to fit more information on screen and to avoid the eyesore that some other calendar widgets produce if you have a dark or transparent theme with your launcher.
FEATURE REQUEST
I checked on fill all day events in the event details settings and it resolved the date issue though events that are longer than 1 day show up as several entries.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent This is the calendar widget that my Note 5 was missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great widget It would be nice to be able to change calendars colors.
FEATURE REQUEST
Should be able to set the shading color for date.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing reset to default setting.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app but still missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Calendar access I would like to be able to see access to my contacts' birthdays/events.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish Samsung would bring their back
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add Google reminder showing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Customize Header I wish I can customize the header because it is really hard to see with out color
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Great widget but you should add weather!
FEATURE REQUEST
Only way I can get it to update/fix is to remove widget and replace.
FEATURE REQUEST
Meh Add an option to start cal at the current date.
FEATURE REQUEST
Miss being able to add a picture to an event and quickly get back to today in home screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
I do not recommend this if you have a bad memory because it does not work when you need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Default month view opening calendar I would like to be able change the default view when opening the calendar app from the widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Exactly what I was looking for This App is perfect and just what I needed for my Samsung Galaxy 6S.
FEATURE REQUEST
UPDATE: I need different background colors for Saturdays & Sundays.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Widget  needs just a bit more Need to add access to all calendars in the account  particularly the task calendar as Google already has this as a calendar so it should be easy.
FEATURE REQUEST
It just occurred to me that it would be great if you could add a new account on the calendars to display screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Map needs improvement When I attempt to use the map feature it always puts me on the other side of the world.
FEATURE REQUEST
You should add option to change the color of the date and highlight today's event
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to see Tasks too I really like the interface and compatible with S Planner calendar nicely but it would be better if I can see tasks that are saved in S Planner too.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish that one feature be added.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it would automatically scroll back to current date and time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make this possible?
FEATURE REQUEST
Not always accurate It was working great  I got a new phone  another Android  and the calendar converts over however since my events carry over to the next day it states the event ends at midnight has a new event on the next day but the time only reads midnight not the time the event ends which is useless as I need to know what time the events end.
FEATURE REQUEST
just when i needed to replace the splanner that is gone
FEATURE REQUEST
Exactly what I needed Schedule mode widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Am I missing something?
FEATURE REQUEST
Widget not updating Needs a fix.
FEATURE REQUEST
Filters need more work.
FEATURE REQUEST
One suggestion Please  add support for birthdays  because they are not events in the calendar application.
FEATURE REQUEST
Doesn't display anything I downloaded this widget so that I could have an easy way to see what I have scheduled for the day without having to get into my calendar.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have to force the update now by changing the settings  but would be great if the developers could fix this bug.
FEATURE REQUEST
One.event show twice When i add an event from 6pm to 2 am it appears twice in different entries after the latest update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish you could adjust the color of each calendar though (versus auto-generated by the app)
FEATURE REQUEST
I can usually only do that once before needing to use the hardware buttons.
FEATURE REQUEST
Worst App App needs root permission
FEATURE REQUEST
But you can add this options to original power menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be cool if it had an option to confirm the reboot.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to see the option to hide some options.
FEATURE REQUEST
BUT i hope u add a confirmation dialog when i tap 1 of those choices bcoz sometimes i accidentally tap the reboot button but i supposed to tap the shutdown button and i cant do anything but wait for it to finish rebooting.
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfectly what I am looking for I love this app using xposed needs a lot reeboot
FEATURE REQUEST
No good coz of this app my phone keeps turning into a Lamborghini Help need my phone back not the Lamborghini
FEATURE REQUEST
Works Perfect  just wish there was a way to have the power button dialog box be replaced with it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to be able to tap outside the popup to close it.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be a widget like thing to make it more productive but awesome all the way.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs a widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add this option?
FEATURE REQUEST
What Android is missing This app fills a void and gives you the functionality you've probably come to expect after using custom ROMs or even carrier-crippled ones.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  it would be cool to have some widgets for Shutdown  reboot etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
No need for power button The only time I'll ever need to use the physical power button is when the phone is off or I'm tinkering with recovery.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add widget option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Widget missing Love the simplicity.
FEATURE REQUEST
Widget Support Please add widgets.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you please add a confirm button  it will be useful for accidental touches
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect for L Useful feature missing in android.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice This app is great and adds the missing reboot to stock devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add sorting of subjects
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish they had step by step instructions!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was some sound though.
FEATURE REQUEST
nice and simple wish it had sound.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great just I wish it was human vs human
FEATURE REQUEST
Miss Taute Awesome!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
All rules pertaining to the game should be contained within the game itself.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's like playing checkers but better!I love it gives me something to do this is how checkers should be played
FEATURE REQUEST
I really appreciate the lack of ads.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game need improvement like turn around
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game Need to be more challenging.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could choose colours as I'm colour blind and some colors look too similar.
FEATURE REQUEST
By far the best Chinese Checkers app I've found Seems there is a lack of good apps for this game  so I'm glad I found this one!!
FEATURE REQUEST
More popular This thing needs more advertising.
FEATURE REQUEST
pls pls add a way to rotate pictures before adding them
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to fix some problem.
FEATURE REQUEST
In the card browser menu  I wish there was an option to mark the cards quickly or in the easiest possible way and that selected cards can be shifted to the desired named deck directly instead of manually going into each card and then select edit option.....to change its deck.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really wished I had found this app sooner it has really been a life changer and I love apps that do just that  change lives.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need help adding notes I'm trying to make a japanese map deck filled with kanji to learn how to read all prefectures and cities.
FEATURE REQUEST
I always get an error adding this note toast.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could have better UI
FEATURE REQUEST
Fix Please update edit screen  add easy option to make cloze cards.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's lacking some editing features that would be helpful but overall it's a great product.
FEATURE REQUEST
Studied for one day and remembered all of the vocab words i needed to know!
FEATURE REQUEST
lots of features I needed an app that would let me register words and their meanings in a certain language with a search feature to use as reference  and this app is perfect for this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to be much more intuitive.
FEATURE REQUEST
The very best app I know It's really really well designed  I can add the words to the dictionary wherever and whenever I want great one  needs some improvements
FEATURE REQUEST
Super marathon This app is fantastic but please add the super marathon after deck has been learned  I mean if a user doesn't have unknown words deck should have super marathon button with all words in it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Don't support reminder and never pop notification.Wow app  I suggest it to anyone Don't support reminder and never pop notification it would be nice if add such option .
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Just what i needed to learn german thanks
FEATURE REQUEST
This app will not let me add or import any decks when they are in the appropriate folder.
FEATURE REQUEST
plz add windows features such as edit deck  i just can use ankidroid.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to create the cards using the (free open source) computer program  it is not possible to create the cards using the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Deck problem I add file to screen as I have made 3 main decks to categories my cards but I don't know how to move files to decks I have created is there any way to do that   I have sentences   Vocabulary and character
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add option that enable us to reset the deck?
FEATURE REQUEST
Useful  but the Android and PC Desktop versions of this software are missing many of the useful editing features available to iPhone/Apple users.
FEATURE REQUEST
And you can waste a lot of time trying to find the missing features you saw in the tutorials  (spoiler: they are not there).
FEATURE REQUEST
Finally  you can search their manual and supporting documentation for some sort of acknowledgement that these features are missing form the Android/PC versions of the software  so you can allow yourself to stop searching in vain and go to bed  but this search will be fruitless too.
FEATURE REQUEST
So  if you want an intelligent program training you on flashcards using spaced repetition  and you don't mind that you can do only the most nominal of editing of the cards themselves  this one is for you.
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI definitely needs to be cleaner and a built in way to get shared decks would be very beneficial
FEATURE REQUEST
My only wish is that you could unsuspend cards in mass.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is that there is no reminder in the app  i wish developers would add this feature soon
FEATURE REQUEST
They just need to add a cloud option where your cards are saved and synced across all your devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice open source app More flashcard content need to be created by users.
FEATURE REQUEST
Text gets deleted after adding a recording
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes cards are not refreshed in the card browser (after adding card)
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome app There are a lot of flash card decks available on AnkiWeb for a lot of major topics  though there are still a few good topics missing
FEATURE REQUEST
Takes a bit of getting used but there's plenty of guidance online should you need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
The current app requires five touches to record audio (+  Add  paperclip  record audio  RECORD).
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great to be able to do this in fewer steps  though I realize that might not be possible without overcrowding the interface.
FEATURE REQUEST
I especially like the improvements to Instant Add API ;)
FEATURE REQUEST
Sound robust app There's a couple of things I miss coming to this from the IOS app such as tapping for answering and advancing in full screen mode  but minor points.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make flash card compatible mnemosyne I'd like to have the abilitie.
FEATURE REQUEST
Recently switched to Anki and now I wish I'd used it all along.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you please add a way to hide them?
FEATURE REQUEST
But I can't record audios when I add new words recently.
FEATURE REQUEST
Like instead of going from Japanese to English  can I do English to Japanese in flashcard decks  rather than doing them individually?
FEATURE REQUEST
If there's already an option for it  I must've missed it lol
FEATURE REQUEST
There is simply no better way to retain information than through flashcard programs like these  and Anki is the program for power users.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing key functionality to be able to flip the cards and show in reverse order.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is complicated learning to create deck and cards  and one needs to be alert if one syncs several devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Previously I used Brainscape on iOS  but it lack of customization features comparing to Anky (and AnkiDroid).
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I know this app earlier.
FEATURE REQUEST
What would be great to improve 1) Support for proxy environments: User name and password dependent internet environments e.g. in uni etc 2) Layout view in card browser: It is a bit painful to see the source code of the flashcards in the card browser - or is there already a way to see change this?
FEATURE REQUEST
Best learning app ever made This and the original desktop version are the best tools anyone could ever need to learn almost anything.
FEATURE REQUEST
To everyone giving it a low rating you need to take the time to learn to use it  anything worth doing takes time to master.
FEATURE REQUEST
I realize it doesn't make much sense to keep it paused for a long time  so maybe the function could be limited to a couple of days.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is really great about usefully and design  but sometimes I need to check my flash cards from my watch not just on the smartphone!
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI needs a little bit of love though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacking some things  but great I think having collaborating or team capabilities (work on decks with friends or classmates  reviewing flashcards with online competition games  gamifying some features (like Quizlet Live or Kahoot  etc.)) would be awesome for classrooms  study groups  friends.
FEATURE REQUEST
Upgrade request Can you add an automatic method to study the cards from back to front?
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it I use this because I need to memorise a lot for university.
FEATURE REQUEST
Yes  AnkiDroid Widget should be added to desktop (thanks to support!)
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but has some limitations Not sure if it even still applies to this version  because I deleted some of my more useless media files long time ago  but it used to have some limitation on number of media files (something to do with either Android or some types of storage iirc  which only allows you about 40 000 files (not sure if this was the exact number) in one folder)  which could be easily fixed by Ankidroid creating additional media folders when you reach the maximum number of files per media folder.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can be better :) If you guys could integrate the mobile version with PC/mac that would be even better.
FEATURE REQUEST
I make a lot of my cards on my mac and it would be great to have those cards on the go.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only wish it were easier to switch between multiple profiles!
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a way to pause the timer
FEATURE REQUEST
I like this app but there are a few things I wish I could change.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could see all of my cards in a deck in a list so I could choose which to look at.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could make decks on my computer and there were a way to synch them on my phone through an account.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the push notifications would send when cards are due  and not only when I actually open the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the push notifications didn't resend any time my screen turns off in the middle of studying a deck.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there were some pre-made decks for students in popular subjects such as anatomy or psychology or languages.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be a tutorial on how to use the app when you first install.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be a ""simple"" option where you just make cards and can review them whenever you want  then have all the complicated features be optional.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please help soon or I might be really upset with you guys.
FEATURE REQUEST
Outstanding application It's a fantastic app to interact with anki world  especially if you need to sync with web profile.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ankidroid does what I need  it doesn't annoy me or crash  and is pretty easy to navigate and use.
FEATURE REQUEST
The best Developers  can you please add a feature wherein instead of adding even the hand drawn images  we could simply draw and save that drawing as a flashcard.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  I love AnkiDroid though  so please add a Quizlet import option!
FEATURE REQUEST
Also you should be able to scroll at the left and use the whiteboard on the right.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish this existed 20 years ago!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I had the option to set pre-configured card settings.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be good if font used for password was changed to one that makes difference in characters like lowercase l and capital i more obvious.
FEATURE REQUEST
make it hard to tell the lowercase l from a capital I (IlIlIlIl) :) Would like to be able to change it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It works It would be better if it did not star out what I type.
FEATURE REQUEST
Was working great   then downloaded more songs and tried to convert them to ringtone's and plays on slow speed .
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks navigation  output undocumented No navigation by folder(location).
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to try others.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I started here.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it Only wish it would let us change the new file's permissions.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see you update it with something that would allow you to randomize selected ringtones to use.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Love this app best ever just needs UI update not too many good ad free apps still
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it was possible for me not to give any stars to this f**king Pls.
FEATURE REQUEST
Uninstalling as I need space.
FEATURE REQUEST
My phone is the best now who needs Apple
FEATURE REQUEST
What can I do
FEATURE REQUEST
There needs to be a way to save files as MP3.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need fix this fast because I use this apps for a long time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Will not play or save in real time Every time I try to cut a song into a ringtone it plays in super slow mo
FEATURE REQUEST
Very hard to use I wish someone could make this easier to use
FEATURE REQUEST
One that works the way I need it to work.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have to manually scroll to find it but once I did it states ""Sorry  Ringdroid is not yet able to edit files of type wma"" .
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to check in deep.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it were for my new Apple 6s.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wma files Need to set this up so it does wma files too and id be set and happy  for now  no
FEATURE REQUEST
It's fast  easy  precise  and does exactly what I need to make ringtones and alarms.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could adjust the volume level of a recording.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need Update Soon.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still wish it had a back up restore option Love it!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could add silence before the ringtone with this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Should be a default app Does exactly what you need to create your own ringtones with ease.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is so easy to use; I might only wish it were easily repurposed as a sound editor.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could mix songs
FEATURE REQUEST
Great for when I'm on the go and need to crop some audio for a ringtone.
FEATURE REQUEST
So u need access to my contacts.
FEATURE REQUEST
cool app...crashes would be good if could add in pause before the tune loops though i think
FEATURE REQUEST
A crop or cut would be nice
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to spy on my contacts list
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to download another one!
FEATURE REQUEST
It does what I need  and does it well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Reinstalling the app resolved the issue .
FEATURE REQUEST
This app use to be my go to now I'm gonna have to uninstall it because it's slow and doesn't even load the songs!
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish there was an easier way to make multiple ringtones at once  or to make a tune more than one thing  I.e. save as ringtone+notification+alarm.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fade tool I wish it had fade-in and fade-out tool
FEATURE REQUEST
It sucks it needs an SD card to run.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lets me choose which part of a song to use for the ringtone which is what I needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
So  4 stars until they add wma support.
FEATURE REQUEST
(Wish list: Any format they are saved in is cool by me  however I'd like to be able to work with WMA's & WAV'S also  please.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you need a app to make Ringtones and Notifications this is the app to download.
FEATURE REQUEST
Crap I don't know what you did but you need to fit it because it's not even music when you try to do anything.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs a redesign and some stability improvements
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but it needs one more thing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Before I could use this app on all music & tones (except protected stuff) with no problem.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I hadn't updated.
FEATURE REQUEST
A tip I hope you add a feature that makes you cut the song from the middle of it
FEATURE REQUEST
Please explain why you need access to my microphone in the change log.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would suggest other users to do the same.
FEATURE REQUEST
Access to contacts in the latest update Great app  but I see no reason it needs to snoop personal info like that.
FEATURE REQUEST
Helps in all d way Would be happy if additional mp3 joiner would b provided by it
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent it will be better if you add a song mixer in this app
FEATURE REQUEST
2015 comment would like to see a filtering option to separate music from ring tone and notifications instead if having to scroll through a long list.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fast and simple All I needed to do after downloading these things I was able to change things that are only ringtones to a notification
FEATURE REQUEST
One of the first apps I install when I get a new phone and one of the few I wouldn't be able to function without.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ring droid Been using this since smartphones came out and it's awesome  does exactly what you want it to.
FEATURE REQUEST
Music isn't on the app I downloaded this app in hope that i would be able to customize my ringtones  but when I opened it  none of my music was on there.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I need Totally appreciable and satisfying app that does what I need in simple steps.
FEATURE REQUEST
It does exactly what you need it to.
FEATURE REQUEST
Loves it Well I didn't really test it out but it will work
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Did what i basically needed which was just cut out a part of a song i had and made it into my ringtone right away :)
FEATURE REQUEST
No way to register Needs a way to register in the App to be useful.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be good if we could add more than 1 image to each complaint.
FEATURE REQUEST
IF YOU GET COUNCILS TO LISTEN & DO WORK WOULD BE GREAT THEN WOULDN'T FEEL LIKE LIVING IN A SLUM AREA!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great idea  needs a lot of improvements.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app great resource but just one question Is there a way the app could be configured to turn off previous reports as atm there are so many in my borough that you cannot view the map when you zoom out in the slightest it is just a screen filled with yellow tags.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also maps need greater detail to help pinpoint problem.
FEATURE REQUEST
App needs to be rewritten!
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way to get to the main menu is to find a recent problem on the map  press it  only then you get the options to see the main menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
If the UK was sorted it would be so much better
FEATURE REQUEST
This is ridiculous  it needs sorting ASAP!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great idea but needs improving.
FEATURE REQUEST
I use it mostly to report graffiti  flyposting  flytipping  and missed bin collections in my local area - I use FillThatHole to report potholes and road defects.
FEATURE REQUEST
If your app could be used to submit OSM map notes it could be adopted as a useful tool with OSM mapper's who are very good at capturing real time data.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see my open reports as like the website.
FEATURE REQUEST
Scrolling in the map is very slow  would be useful if you could also see issues in your area like on the website.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app itself needs a little fixing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not good when you're making sure that you're not double reporting a problem.
FEATURE REQUEST
it is a great app  but it needs details on where to find certain fish & other items.
FEATURE REQUEST
Will be better if you include weapon/armor pictures
FEATURE REQUEST
For Future Update Please add an information about breakable parts of every monster in simple description
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but needs a little more Mostly just needs requirements and such for specific quests  and unlocks for the completion of request quests  showing the quests or sets unlocked
FEATURE REQUEST
Very important tool for any hunter highly recommend But would be better being able to relate armour sets to monsters abit easier.
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe you could add the hunter arts?
FEATURE REQUEST
To be an Offline version of Kiranico  all it needs now it's the Health values of the target.
FEATURE REQUEST
please add pictures for the weapons Adding pictures for the weapons will be a cherry on top so we hunters don't have to switch back and forth to see how weapons look like
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls add images Its really good but i would appreciate it if there are images of the weapons  armors and monsters
FEATURE REQUEST
But this app helps out so much with planning armor sets  knowing what materials you need  enemy weaknesses  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its great nearly perfect needs more materials though
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish there was an enlarged area map that shows where gathering/fishing spots are
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs a big update on quest.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best App 4 MHGen Info This app has everything i need to know armor  weapons  skills  monsters and how to counter them  Quest  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's lacking the newer event quests which I understand specific drop rates aren't easy to get but in context it would be nice to have the information so I know whether or not doing the event quest is worthwhile.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ok i guess Needs a cross check with the online info.
FEATURE REQUEST
Yes it has some correct info but is missing some as well as not all info is correct (ex: armor max defense).
FEATURE REQUEST
A way to sort thru weapons would be nice also.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good app It seems to be missing some location/quest info for some items
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect guide I think it needs to update every month to keep up with DLC Quests and other info..like how to unlock special armors  quests  hunting arts  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome App for any hunter NEEDS NO PERMISSIONS!
FEATURE REQUEST
Flawless  but i have a idea Is there some way you could make the app sync to my game so i could see my materials so if i wanted to make the cosmic edge for example  it could tell me i have the accolade but am missing some other materials  then i now what to farm  and then maybe shows quests with highest chance to get the items?
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls update and add more I suggest that in armor sets.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing Sure a few things here or there would be nice to fix up but all around almost a flawless app
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app missing just a bit of stuff but I usually can find it miself other than that rlly useful I recommend it if u play mh generations
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is great  it has accurate information that helps when I'm not near a computer but still need to look something up.
FEATURE REQUEST
Having this app makes my (hunter) life so much easier : just a quick glance and I know everything I need to know wherever I am
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Love the app but might I add a suggestion  how about in the quest list add a new color for the different villages and their quest.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic app  does exactly everything I need it to  except  on the wish lists.
FEATURE REQUEST
It has what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not all of the values are correct on armor and is missing some of the drop tables on certain things.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very few things missing small monster locations and such but nothing that would make this app a deal breaker.
FEATURE REQUEST
But there is a few things missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
A update would be cool.
FEATURE REQUEST
A must have for the dedicated hunter Given the amount of info needed to play the game this makes a good compliment to an already intese gameplay experience.
FEATURE REQUEST
Informs you on everything you need to know if your playing monster hunter gen you should definitely download this app
FEATURE REQUEST
It's only missing a few things.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fish locations outside Quest rewards sections  and I need to know locations of items you cannot buy or gather in Quests.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need that added  as I have to resort to Monster Hunter Reddit  since most of the info not in this app is not on Kiranico  the number one place to look for Monster Hunter info for a few Monster Hunter games.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add that missing info in the app if it does not lag it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App Monster hunter generations is my firs Monster Hunter game and toys app made learning what i needed to work toward much easier instead of just throwing things together
FEATURE REQUEST
Several info's missing The app is awesome  other than the fact that a lot of info's are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but need some attention It's a great app  but it hasn't some features such as ""adding widgets on desktop"" or gesture etc  when using it as default Launcher.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very very good app but Everything is perfect except I would like to use it as a shortcut on my own launcher  so if there's an option that you can desable the recent apps and just manually edit which apps is appeard on the drawer it would be complete
FEATURE REQUEST
No widgets support Good app but do something so that widgets can also be added.
FEATURE REQUEST
You should be able to scroll through your pinned/recent apps instead of only allowing icons until it reaches the screen width/height.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hide Menu Home button should have a toggle for initial stage of taskbar i.e. collapsed or showing.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could change the app drawer icon to my liking.
FEATURE REQUEST
$ STARS Plz add options to increase column size (Grid view) and categorization (list view).
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe I even could use this in conjunction with parallel windows.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app 馃憤 It would be better if there is an option to set the position of trigger at the bottom middle of the screen..along with recent apps in the two sides.
FEATURE REQUEST
5 stars if If ""icon packs"" was as easy to find apply as they should be.I would also like to be able if possible to have a widget as the ""start"" button that displays the date  the weather  or other common ""widget"" type ""information ticker"".
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls add separate hide button for recent apps (pinned apps) 2 .
FEATURE REQUEST
And never has there been a tab or window for recent apps  not that I need it on this phone as there is a button at the bottom for that.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Would be nice if the position could also be in the left or right centre.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app.need to add more feature.double tap to sleep.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add double tap to sleep Add double tap to sleep and make lastest recent apps on left please bro :) i like this launcher
FEATURE REQUEST
Tried using it as a home replacement and it needs a few more things before I can switch permanently.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would surely use some MULTI WINDOW on my phone  please help with that.
FEATURE REQUEST
notification issue need to add option for hiding notification.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be good If I could manually set what appears in the start menu and if I could put folders into it  much like my windows stay menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  I'd like to be able to customise the button icon to match my launcher theme.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hope you continue to develop more features for this app 馃榾 Additional I'd really love to see if adding widgets could be possible and try adding some animations to how the app drawer opens and how the taskbar itself collapses like a receding animation maybe?
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacking animations Lacking animations.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great to have the ability to change the ""app drawer"" icon or make it change to a black one when selecting ""dark theme"".
FEATURE REQUEST
Liked it Pretty good if the widget should be placed where ever we want rather than the bottom left  top right or something else...
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish I had the pixel c so I could run it there too!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great  but needs a little work This app is great  but It needs a little work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Using this as the default task switcher on my Nvidia shield and there is no way to override the default Google now assistant that is bound to meta key
FEATURE REQUEST
doesn't move my music every time i try to move my music to sd card it sats 0 files transfered and ___errors have appeared
FEATURE REQUEST
If it doesn't let you save on your SD card you need to root and use sd fixer.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app should be renamed 'move to internal memory' coz it does so to another section of it and not SD card
FEATURE REQUEST
Useful App Please add optional Plus sign (+) at SD Card word in popup dialog for easy to use.
FEATURE REQUEST
Dumbass You download this to free up space meaning that you have no space to download this
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed to do a factory reset on my phone  used this app to save my music  pics  even my color notes  to the SD card.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I have 100 times the memory for adding other apps.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app NEEDS TO BE STANDARD ON EVERY PHONE!!!!!!!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Sd is were I need this it works
FEATURE REQUEST
This program does something that should be built -in to every OS.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does not transfer I have tried to transfer my stuff 3 times and each time it said it was complete.
FEATURE REQUEST
Send to SD card I must have misunderstood the perpious of the card I needed more space on my phone I put a 32gigs card in my phone to better organize my space and room on my phone it put my things where it wanted to put them in folders that had nothing to do with each other and some things I couldn't transfer at all
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to free up space on my phone and have been trying for days.
FEATURE REQUEST
An essential missing part of android.
FEATURE REQUEST
Once they are moved there is no way to retrieve or view them.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like this because I couldn't save my music on my sd card so now I can upload my notification ringtones to my sd card now and now when I get a new phone I will still be able to have my music still so that's great love it
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be better if you could optionally display some EXIF text like captions (from Picasa) on the floating images & when clicked rather than just filename.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish we could give these less intelligent people toward electronics and apps more help as fans.
FEATURE REQUEST
There needs to be an app where fans can interact and asks fan related questions and help.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to have a timer.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Please add Chromecast for 5 stars!
FEATURE REQUEST
It should be named something else because it behaves more like a floating picture gallery or a screensaver app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd like the ability to select only certain pictures from a folder.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is PERFECT for what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just please add the British penny as a selectable coin
FEATURE REQUEST
Now it just needs to always pick the flip that's best for me.
FEATURE REQUEST
He was an electrical engineer at one of the national nuclear labs  and the result was consequently way better than it needed to be.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had a more realistic flip animation but hey.
FEATURE REQUEST
Exactly what one needs a coin for!
FEATURE REQUEST
nice does exactly what it says and what I need it for.
FEATURE REQUEST
Handy Dandy Has resolved many conflicts for myself & the kids.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Simple and everything it needs to be without any junk.
FEATURE REQUEST
simple and does exactly what i need it to do.
FEATURE REQUEST
It missed a tarmac path used by cyclists.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was better integration with rental bike places showing empty slots near destination.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is it trying to stick to dedicated cycle routes?
FEATURE REQUEST
The one thing I feel would be an absolute godsend would be if the sustrans routes were marked on the downloadable maps  or if a version of the open cycle map were downloadable (even if it needs updating from time to time).
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd also like to be able to export my routes to other software.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't use the LiveRide feature (ehich needs some work) I just look at the map on my handlebars.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cycle streets Really good app for cycle friendly streets  and I like that on live ride it tells you to get ready to turn  my only wish was that at the get ready stage  I wish it told you the upcoming road name as most of the time it doesn't tell you until you're actually turning and if you aren't looking at screen (phone in pocket) it's too late!
FEATURE REQUEST
Best all round offline maps Would love a feature to be able to measure between points while offline.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need quiet routes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also badly needs a menu button for recent Android versions.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now it just needs to let me know the name of the street I'm turning down a second or two earlier and it will be perfect.
FEATURE REQUEST
Superb You need the huge offline map pack also  or a good data budget.
FEATURE REQUEST
All you need All you need for finding cycle routes  navigation don't always pick cycle routes when wanting directions during cycling but then I never really use that bit.
FEATURE REQUEST
Seems like a pretty big thing to miss off a route planning app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I run the CycleStreets on a tablet tossed into my pannier which can provide many hours of GPS navigation.
FEATURE REQUEST
I reached my destination but only after having to double back on myself a few times due to the voice navigation being slow at telling when I needed to turn - this was even after changing the settings to be notified 150m before a turn  hopefully this will be sorted in later versions.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be better if you could add/move waypoints to adjust the route after it has been calculated.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really good but needs some work Really good app  would be better if you could view elevation data for planned routes  re-routing was quicker and better UI.
FEATURE REQUEST
Up need to fix the app or update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wirks great just needs improvement on sound quality.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent It worked like a magic...i was stuggling to listen to music thru my mono samsung hm1100 bluetooth headset..this app has resolved my problem.
FEATURE REQUEST
user inteface could be improved.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but has some problems Cannot open a re褋ent database if root access is required.
FEATURE REQUEST
Settings are inac褋essible inside DB view so you need to close DB to change font or page size.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app Works well  but would be better if you could save multiple queries though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works OK for what I need Only thing I would like is to be able to clone a field from the previous record in the database without going thru the whole ""edit field  delete the data  type the new data  save"" sequence.
FEATURE REQUEST
User interface could use lots of improvement.
FEATURE REQUEST
The file navigation needs help.
FEATURE REQUEST
However it lacks support for some features like creating a table with constraints.
FEATURE REQUEST
But I think you should allow table to be modified after its creation!
FEATURE REQUEST
Could do with a 'jump to row' option when viewing large tables (120K rows)
FEATURE REQUEST
very useful to help me develop android app  i hope you keep this free
FEATURE REQUEST
I just needed to see my bookmarks; this is great!
FEATURE REQUEST
UNUSABLE Can you do something about scaling your views correctly for a tablet?
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if you could select all records for delete after applying filter.
FEATURE REQUEST
App should provide a commit button or other proactive ui to commit and should warn user about losing changes before any action that would drop changes  e.g.  exit  occurs.
FEATURE REQUEST
works great for exporting I need an app to export a db to CSV  this one works great and it's free!
FEATURE REQUEST
I get an error that supersu pro is required.
FEATURE REQUEST
It does what it's supposed to do  could be better It works fine for casual editing  I like it a lot!
FEATURE REQUEST
But for development it lacks many features.
FEATURE REQUEST
In data view the row should be highlighted if I press my finger on the screen and trigger edit on long press.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be good to be able to choose light/dark display.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good App Good application; needs to fill the screen on data view.
FEATURE REQUEST
Easy and accurate Being new to the BART system I knew I needed a reliable way of checking the schedule to see if I should hurry or not.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need this app to see how fast I need to run from my car to the station!
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately  I'm usually planning ahead and need to know when to get to the station.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple design  simple ui  all you need to know when the next train (or three) are coming and when you'll get to your destination.
FEATURE REQUEST
All I needed + wanted Great app
FEATURE REQUEST
Quick response Always starts up fast when I need it and is accurate.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fare calculation would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic app Could use some quality of life improvements  but nothing that would drop the rating below 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
The Best I wish there was a way to lock the departure schedule.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best BART app available Shows me exactly what I need to know and nothing else to get in the way.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not bad  but could use more functions.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if the schedule included the last train or two to leave  so I can see when the train I'm already on will arrive.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding new routes is extremely easy.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Bart schedule
FEATURE REQUEST
Android wear support would be super cool.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fellow coder I wish i made more things like this in my life.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app Missing a feedback button and a settings button.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good enough This app lacks one thing: an ability to set up notifications for delays.
FEATURE REQUEST
Every so often the system has a problem and it would be nice to be told about them rather than open the app to find out.
FEATURE REQUEST
Thank you sooo much for never letting me miss the opportunity of using the restroom because I am afraid of missing the train.
FEATURE REQUEST
The timing information is there so that this feature could be added.
FEATURE REQUEST
An alarm when you get close to your destination would also be cool because I've slept past my destination more than once.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  needs one thing I love this app  one feature that would be great is the ability to swap the departure/destination fields with the tap of a button like you can in Google maps.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  but lacking a bit.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best Bart app for frequent commuter It has exactly what you need without adding complexity.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs an option to lock routes list on the home screen From time to time I accidentally delete some routes from the home screen - they may be deleted by a very slight swipe when you're going to tap on a route.
FEATURE REQUEST
So  you need to add the same route again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to have an option to lock the list of routes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app but missing AirBart Works nice but it misses the connection to OAK / AirBart.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if you could set layover times yourself  with big luggage or slow walking vs profi runner
FEATURE REQUEST
It has a couple neat add ins like a system map  system announcements and elevator updates.
FEATURE REQUEST
Small in size and easy to use  it got me where I needed to be and let me tell my friends when to expect me at the station because I was able to use the SFO wifi.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see all trains from a station in a direction  so for example all northbound trains from MacArthur  without specifying an endpoint.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it linked to the schedule (so I could check lest train times) and listed arrival information for a given stop without having to input the destination.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some nice features  but lacking overall The app's nicest feature is the countdown to the next departing train from a given station.
FEATURE REQUEST
I ended up at the end of the bay point line when I needed to be in Richmond.
FEATURE REQUEST
Future schedules aren't available (suggest BART Usher if you need this).
FEATURE REQUEST
It doesn't tell you that you need to transfer in Bay Fair and I know you do.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hold that train Good ap  last star if you add $ per trip.
FEATURE REQUEST
Much better than others Can you make it where I can color my favorites?
FEATURE REQUEST
Only a handful of commands are needed to survive its command line interface :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Nothing works I really need to open a file.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs Work 1) Being that my device is rooted  I set in preferences for it to use root powers; but the moment I did this and granted root access to it  it wouldn't open  so I had to reset it  losing all my settings!
FEATURE REQUEST
Yes it's vim but needs some improvements Since Android 5.0  I've noticed the overlaying app could use some changes.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  I need to be able to manually set 藴 (aka $HOME) to /sdcard.
FEATURE REQUEST
I know android already had a vi in its shell  but the lack of physical keyboard made it unusable.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to use VIM base ver 7.4.399 or higher so I can use blowfish 2 encryption since blowfish 1 has a security flaw.
FEATURE REQUEST
Gets around the lack of cursor keys.
FEATURE REQUEST
As I say  that took many days  since I would have to wait for a couple of days to see if the phone would reboot or not .
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs a little work in making the defaults a bit more touch friendly  but it's very usable as is.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I need A plain simple trusty editor
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately  it crashes occasionally and why does Vim try to handle PDFs?
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice editor Classic VIM editor that works very well  it is missing a few things though like undo.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I need!
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice but... There should be a alarm reminder option where I control when the alarm sounds for each task like most calendars have.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good for one time tasks Missing a critical option which is to add a recurring task (paying bills  exercising  etc.)
FEATURE REQUEST
Harsh vora Nice app but if possible give facility to set task list like if i need 4-5 stages like as per my business i need to generate client then set stages like 1 praposal 2 receipt 3 policy 4 policy delivery and once i set it then it is always on all of my task then i have to give only task name stages will appeare autmatically
FEATURE REQUEST
Really Good Really good app  just wish it would sync with Google tasks but for free can't ask more  could add heaps more improvement which I'm sure will be added in time.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be even better if there was another program that worked equally well with caldav/ical VJOURNAL entries then we could have full synchronization with contacts  tasks  and notes/memos/journals via carddav and caldav.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be good to be able to sort lists order manually rather than alfabethacly.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also it'd be good if sound notification could be customised.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works as advertised Very basic  but does what I need it to.
FEATURE REQUEST
Widget Needs Improvement The widget should display only one of my lists.
FEATURE REQUEST
free as in beer does exactly what i need it to do and respectful of my information.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazingly useful - the ability to add a checklist within a task means I can use it for things like shopping lists or project progress without having to have a separate item on the todo list for each individual item.
FEATURE REQUEST
Loses a star for lack of recurring task support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Once they add that  it will be a 5-star app for sure.
FEATURE REQUEST
It seems there may be two or more standards for specifying them: one way wherein the subtask is entered as a new line in the Description field  and another using a more formal specification.
FEATURE REQUEST
I recommend it to anyone who needs lists to follow like I do.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there any way you can add the ability to export and import these lists?
FEATURE REQUEST
I have several lists that I do several times months apart but don't like them hanging around till I need them again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was a way to print these lists  email them or share them with others.
FEATURE REQUEST
OK but should allow reordering tasks It's OK  but it badly needs the ability to manually reorder the tasks  rather than being stuck in alphabetical order.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see an option to strike the task as complete from the widget itself.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works Would be nice if it supported sub (nested) task lists.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it will be great if I can create more task list.
FEATURE REQUEST
it needs to have lists and folders for lists.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but widget needs improvement Great to do app!
FEATURE REQUEST
But I would like to be able to resize the widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
The sync works  but the app doesn't support the assigned categories  which I need for sorting and filtering.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just one problem to fix please The app is lacking support for repetitive reminding such as a weekly or a 2 monthly dates  also you can't compleat these kind of tasks ( for the current date) and expect them to show up automatically after that like how it is done on ios.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the developer can create a similar app for note taking.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to open whatever port you have set for connection  in your firewall (the app default is port 5500) and set your IP address for your local system that you wish to connect to  and you're done!
FEATURE REQUEST
I only wish it could stream the music to my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it suported streaming (upnp) .
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app and works really well  the only addition I would appreciate is the ability to search a track and then play it immediately (or queue it so you can skip straight to it) rather than just adding it to the playlist.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its not connecting with laptop I have installed clementine version 1.3.1 on my laptop and then installed this remote on my samsung core2.....i enabled network remote control also....then i tried all the 3 ip addresses it was showing me on the first screen in phone...but it is still not connecting...pls suggest what to do
FEATURE REQUEST
Lack of support for older versions of Clementine has made this completely useless to me.
FEATURE REQUEST
And of course given the ecosystem there is no official way to downgrade the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very Useful Simple  light app..you can even download the songs using this..simply amazing
FEATURE REQUEST
I should also be able to quit without opening the app  either add an x to notification or let me swipe it away.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app works well  but need some improvements to make it more user friendly.
FEATURE REQUEST
The one thing is is like to ""love"" songs to better tweak my playlist generation and though the description says I should be able to do that with the app  I can't find any such thing.
FEATURE REQUEST
What am I missing?
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice It's great as is  but I'd like to be able to load playlists from the main player.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also browsing by file instead of just by artists would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
But  the only thing I think this app needs to be perfect is it's being able to stream songs that are on android.
FEATURE REQUEST
That way all of my compilation and mix albums would be together!
FEATURE REQUEST
Really good But in my nexus 5 I have to unlock the screen in order to use the controls  maybe it is an operating system issue(I'm using lollipop)  but it would be great if something would be done about it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe the only thing that need improvement is the Library slot.
FEATURE REQUEST
For that we need to donate!
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent  but lacking some features This is a fantastic app  and would be five stars if not for some missing functionality with playlists.
FEATURE REQUEST
You should be able to play any saved playlist  even if they are not opened in a tab of the player  and you should be able to play smart playlists.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really good but add a sort by album option to the library This app is awesome  really good  works really well and is very stable.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is what I need!
FEATURE REQUEST
Oh my darling Clementine Works nicely  would be nice to an upload facility too!
FEATURE REQUEST
Please Please  please  please  add a queue option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love the way I can be listening to an album and think I ought to have this album on my phone  so I just hit download!
FEATURE REQUEST
(Only adding music to my iPod nano 6.gen. does not work :( ).
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to use it :-( [Update] You need to use the developers version to get it to work on Ubuntu 14.04  now to find out how to control it from Wear ;-) Use the developer PPA and upgrade  all is well (i needed a dist-upgrade before it installed)
FEATURE REQUEST
There are a couple missing features  however  that are really noticeable.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be a way to clear a playlist with one tap.
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe the devs could add a few more features  like: being able to see the ratings in the playlist; being able to organize playlists differently  I.e. by artist  by rating  etc. ; and  being able to queue songs from the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is just what I needed to control music from my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great Would like to see library organized by genre or other sort than just artist
FEATURE REQUEST
One should be given the choice on how to browse the library  just like in the desktop version.
FEATURE REQUEST
You never know that you are missing something until it comes along and This is a game changer for me!
FEATURE REQUEST
I just love the lack of ads in this app  and it does the job perfectly!
FEATURE REQUEST
playlist and library functionality on remote app needs a bit of work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  but some functionality is missing There is no option to replace current playlist.
FEATURE REQUEST
Didn't even know I wanted that feature but it stopped me missing that call!!
FEATURE REQUEST
This needs 1.2.1 at least.
FEATURE REQUEST
Then it would be great !
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I needed!
FEATURE REQUEST
This is just what I need  would be good to be able to manage playlists better (such as clear all items from a playlist and add and delete lists) and to also add all tracks to a playlist so that all tracks can be shuffled..keep up the good work:)
FEATURE REQUEST
Speaking of which  Please add the option to seek from lockscreen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Didn't even know I needed it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Library streaming would be a killer feature if that could be included.
FEATURE REQUEST
Was gonna ask if there was a way to backup created/saved streams to external storage for example but read on Github that that option was removed?
FEATURE REQUEST
This is what I needed Of all the ""white noise generator""s out there  this is the only one that really generates noise and doesn't play whacky ""nature sounds"".
FEATURE REQUEST
Great tool  but would be even better with some numbers.
FEATURE REQUEST
I usually need to listen to NASA space sounds to sleep but when my internet is out this is a life saver.I can make it sound pretty much like the magnetic fields of Ganymede or Neptune.Thank you for this awesome app!!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Helps me sleep &gt;&gt;Added April 2016: I honestly wish there was some way to pay for this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if it stopped on headphone disconnect  but the lock screen widget makes it easy to stop it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could help update the ui a little.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  but need to improve It works best with Magisk.
FEATURE REQUEST
But I think the UI of this app is not friendly as SuperSU's and should be improved
FEATURE REQUEST
Remove zip that was flashed If you didn't make a recovery is there an Uninstaller zip that you can flash to remove phh superuser 17.
FEATURE REQUEST
Icon Please add a new nice superuser icon.
FEATURE REQUEST
If I want to connect to my machine  I always need to use the IP address - if I use the machine name (which is persistent - in opposition with the IP addess)  it just can't find it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I always need to check  or find out  what is the IP.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but . . . Needs to include the Samba's Server function to allow me to share files from my mobile devices while sitting at my PC.
FEATURE REQUEST
The best of the genre in Play Store However  it would be nice if the app could: 1) Calculate the hash of files/folders sent from other apps (maybe as command line parameter); 2) Remember selected options.
FEATURE REQUEST
Work for what I need Only requiring the basic minimalistic permissions.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd also love to be able to Share a file TO this app for a quick way to add a file to it.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you add more hash algorithm i will give you five stars!
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing 1 feature I love It works great but needs the ability to remember last used algorithm instead of always using MD5 by default.
FEATURE REQUEST
Yup  does as expected Appreciate the lack of permissions needed!
FEATURE REQUEST
That would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Root request it need root access but not notice   wasted
FEATURE REQUEST
ok  but could be much better missing material design 馃敼text overlapping on scroll 馃敼 not so intuitive.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be very useful if there was a setting to hide any lines containing the package name or uid or other app-specific identifiers (possibly disabled automatically after a crash).
FEATURE REQUEST
Says it needs root access to read files.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not user friendly it needs to be updated so it could work with lollipop and above.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd suggest adding a feature to capture only a specific process individually (per app).
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to be redone.
FEATURE REQUEST
It works as stated in that you can see catch any random force close when trying to figure out an issue  however it seems dev needs to code the menu button for lollipop up.
FEATURE REQUEST
This essentially makes the tool useless to me as I need to extract and email the logs.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a way to filter logs by error level (warning  info  debug etc).
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  app need to use new Android navigation method instead of menu key as this key is obsolete in newer Android devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Root access If your app need root access  you should have said so in the description!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it wouldn't require root.
FEATURE REQUEST
鈽嗏槅鈽嗏槅鈽?FOR THE FIRST 3 { SAMSUNG GALAXY S2 + S3 + S4 } 銆?NOW I USE THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 + &lt; NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 &gt; 銆?THIS APPLICATION USE WITH THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 * I GIVE ONLY 4 STARS &lt; 鈽嗏槅鈽嗏槅 &gt; DUE TO THE REVISION OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM OF THE S5 ) I FEEL THAT THE DEVELOPERS  SHOULD HAVE A REVISION FOR THE S5.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just need an visual update but I can live with that A+
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be even better if material design is implemented!!!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Otherwise would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app for rooted devices I haven't had a situation where I actually needed this app  but it gives you an interesting look at what's going on in your phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish it didn't scroll all the way to the end of the paused or saved log you were viewing each time you switch away from the app  or even just when the phone goes to sleep  thereby causing you to lose your place in the log.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works but needs UI updates At least it works after converting it to a system app and giving it root permissions unlike some other apps that are useless on Android 4.1.1+
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but needs UI overhaul The needs of this application are fully met  it's just the UI that needs an overhaul now!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish this app would update though
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs to implement the 3 dot button for devices with physical keys and no menu button.
FEATURE REQUEST
A Troubleshooting Must Have My only complaint is the lack of an easy to find legend.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is the only log viewing app I've found so far that I think should be included with the Android OS.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it would include the Society tables.
FEATURE REQUEST
The perfect GM tool I use this in nearly every section when things need to be cleared out fast.
FEATURE REQUEST
Bless This saves me from looking in lots of different books when I just need to find one thing really quick!
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is amazing Only one request update the paladin archetypes you're missing tortured crusader and a few others can you also put 3rd party classes and races on here
FEATURE REQUEST
Quick and easy to use it has resolved many rule issues and magic item queries.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish it updated more often  it's still missing bestiary 5 and the full occult adventures content.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could add a character sheet it would finish this off perfect
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but I wish more material was in it.
FEATURE REQUEST
The extra supplicants  like creatures of the night  that add alternate rules and/or adittional species and archetypes
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be even better if you could connect to the pathfinder character sheet app from Prometheus Apps.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome app I don't normally rate things  but needed to say how great this app is.
FEATURE REQUEST
All i'm missing is a feat list in tree form and full pages for unchained classes rather than just the tables!
FEATURE REQUEST
There are always places and other ways to bookmark  and while my only complaint is that haunts are missing  as well as the new intrigue not being added as well yet  with time I am certain this even will change
FEATURE REQUEST
Essential for every GM All the info you need to run pathfinder in one app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to get if you are going.
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect The only thing this app is missing is a character sheet that runs off of it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately it needs to be updated badly.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see some of the newer content.
FEATURE REQUEST
It just would be nice if it was
FEATURE REQUEST
Anything I need to know about I can bring up within seconds and it includes alot of knowledge for newbies like myself or even veterans of the game.
FEATURE REQUEST
Edit: One more thing that I noticed  the deities are missing from the cleric domain list.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish updates adding new books came out more frequently (Ultimate Intrigue  please!!)
FEATURE REQUEST
deities This guide is really great but could you add the pathfinder deities too?
FEATURE REQUEST
Insanely useful I absolutely love this; it gives me everything I need  works WITHOUT an internet connection  and the best part is I don't need to buy all the books once I have this baby.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish spells had more ways to be sorted through  but they are alphabetically listed for each class.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very handy  a few things missing This app will be saving my life later.
FEATURE REQUEST
That said  it could use the information found in the ""Book of Angels"" and ""Blood of Fiends"" player's companions  as well as other books with alternate race options.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it was updated quicker but I figure it's a labor of love of the author.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some third party classes would be nice  too.
FEATURE REQUEST
A great example Very well organized  I desperately wish there was an equivalent for fifth.
FEATURE REQUEST
Feats however could use more filters  it's a long list.
FEATURE REQUEST
It could use some improvements Its a bit difficult to navigate through it could use some adjustments like filters or something
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but needs updating Very handy  but missing some of the latest spells and needs bringing up to date.
FEATURE REQUEST
New book needs to be added but apart from that  extremely helpful.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed a spell reference mainly during game.
FEATURE REQUEST
Even with all softcover content understandably missing  I still use this to reference material far more often than bothering with the pfsrd for the stuff that it does have.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very helpful when you're in character build mode or when you need a quick look up at the table.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing links Noticed that feral child is not listed in the class archetypes however when searched specifically is immediately there to be found.
FEATURE REQUEST
makes me wonder what else is missing its link.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hopefully the crashing has been fixed in this update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app It does everything i need it to :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Great reference Thanks for adding Occult Adventures and Pathfinder Unchained.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app overall  though I wish they'd keep adding new content as it's released - there's been pretty close to nothing new on here since advanced class guide.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good but missing Awesome reference but I still don't see any inner sea books.
FEATURE REQUEST
Psionics I love the app very useful for nearly everything  but the addition of psionics info would be even more useful  my groups campaigns frequently involve psionics in some form or another.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can still easily find what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Handy Occult adventureschas been on the prd for some to but this Needs occult adventuers to be added occult adventures has been on paizos prd web site for some time now.
FEATURE REQUEST
seeing a really cool feat  then seeing that it had 8 prereqs and you need to be level 18 is kinda disheartning gripe number two: youre probably already in the process of adding all the new stuff  but its not done.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great reference but missing one thing!
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could add it it'd be great!
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see a compatible entry system to add new information.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it had psionic information in it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome but missing Any word on when the app will get Pathfinder Unchained  Occult Adventures  and Bestiary 5?
FEATURE REQUEST
Just missing unchained and occult of stuff that is on the prd.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm curious as to when the next set of rules will come out though (occult adventures and bestiary 5)  but the system is simple enough and if you need to find it asap then search it  I love it!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but incomplete It's super useful but a little inconvenient because it's missing some stuff.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but missing recent information I love this app  extremely useful for reference.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  it needs an update including the Beastiary 5  Occult Adventures  and the new Mythic books.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if they updated to include the Occult classes.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing is Unchained.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great reference for quick searches Sometimes you just need to confirm spell duration  fringe maneuver cases or weapon info.
FEATURE REQUEST
All you need to play pathfinder
FEATURE REQUEST
But the lack of visual aid is sad(pictures  art  characters  etc.)
FEATURE REQUEST
Can't wait till you add the occultist classes to the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd like the ability to bookmark from a search (without clicking into the page)  but good nonetheless.
FEATURE REQUEST
The interface is very user friendly and it has all the info you need to play the game and more.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if it would reinstall
FEATURE REQUEST
wish it had 3pp information as well   but other then that it's great
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but missing some things  like the occult classes
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs occult class update Great  but it needs the info for the occult classes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App Would like to see more updates for newer books but is absolutely great.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could make character sheets with this as well  it'd be all you need to play
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  but not completely up to date This apps is an indispensable tool  but if is missing info from a couple of the newer books  particularly Occult Adventures.
FEATURE REQUEST
It searches easily for anything you need to find  and the information there us as it appears in the rules.
FEATURE REQUEST
One thing I think would make this amazing One thing I think would make this amazing would be the ability to import our own content  such as custom races.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic reference app  just missing a few things I really like this app and use it every time I play!
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to get the missing books added in though  mainly the Occult so I can have faster reference for my kineticist.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Missing a lot of new materials.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Thank you for making this app but it would be better if it shows verbs' english meaning
FEATURE REQUEST
a good app  it will be better if there's meaning for the words you type in
FEATURE REQUEST
This needs to be corrected to account for final consonants.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love the website version of this app  however the app is lacking the features which I used the website for!
FEATURE REQUEST
A translation of the verbs would be nice  but chances are if you're attempting to conjugate it  you already know what it means.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish the translated word could be included as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
A) wxmaxima needs an official fb page  so that people have their potential questions answered.
FEATURE REQUEST
I use it with my students in class and thought it might be fun to have it on my tablet.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would use this app for the rest of my life
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Great UX  wish it had card layout option and ability to flip through posts side to side
FEATURE REQUEST
Just missing one thing.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to be able to reorder the subreddits.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if spotify was enabled too ;)
FEATURE REQUEST
I just would like in an update that when I stop playing the music  I don't have to force close the app so the notification disappears.
FEATURE REQUEST
Inconsistent Often  does not scrobble  or will stack em up in cache and you need to do it manually.
FEATURE REQUEST
Apple Music not supported I wish I could scrobble while I'm using Apple Music.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it would pull tracks that don't broadcast and just take track info from notification of what is playing so apps like YouTube Music and Bandcamp would work.
FEATURE REQUEST
edit: nvm  just have to change its color.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best browser on play store but please add ""reopen closed tab"" button
FEATURE REQUEST
opening tabs needs to have a function that allows u to open new tabs without automatically switching to that tab
FEATURE REQUEST
Overall good but some sites could be blocked by cellular operator
FEATURE REQUEST
My only complaint is I wish I had tried it earlier.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be very nice if you could download stuff.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could do that it would be good.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could add a value between these  it would be really great  since it's not comfortable like this for me.
FEATURE REQUEST
A few thigs need fixing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great for now Everything is working smooth and nice but it would be cool if the fullscreen mode would hide the adress/action bar and keep the status bar and scrolling up (or pressing implemented menu button next to recent apps button) would bring the adress/action bar up.
FEATURE REQUEST
And also if you could improve page scrolling a bit it would be great...the scrolling is smooth but leaves the page white for a second if scrolling very fast...not a huge problem but could be solved i believe.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome browser But needs the ability to sync bookmarks with Firefox.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like this app a lot  but it would be nice if you implement material design
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Needs column headings on the downloads and ratings screens.
FEATURE REQUEST
Even official Play Console app lacks some of the features of this one.
FEATURE REQUEST
I looked for it since Google uploaded their Developer Console app (which is terrible and is missing a lot of information).
FEATURE REQUEST
I think we developers should contribute in your github :( This app is rated only be developers.
FEATURE REQUEST
That's why there are no assholeness in this group.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great This app is very helpful for us  the developers who needs to check our apps often and check the feedback on comments.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs update 5 stars when you add in support for multiple publisher accounts  not very useful for professional developers managing many apps on multiple publisher accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I needed Does everything I need it to  and it even provides info that's not available from the website.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very well done You should try to materialize the design and people will love it even more :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to fix some bugs with comments and ranking notifications  but otherwise a great app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would suggest that rather than use the comment count  note the text of the very last comment made.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love it if you could add crashes and ANRS report otherwise its perfect
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Material design would be nice
FEATURE REQUEST
I also think that the date should reflect the date from Google  not zeros when Google doesn't bother to update the stats for a few days.
FEATURE REQUEST
GOOGLE  PLEASE GIVE US AN API FOR DEVELOPER STATS.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make an app which can show live statistics from the Wallet merchant too (food for thought!)
FEATURE REQUEST
Time is money Android wear support would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Decent The UI is a bit awkward and I wish it could use the graphs directly from the Developer Console instead of generating it's own over time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes reply buttons are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
You guys need to fix it already.
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect for me Would be nice be able refresh only selected applications not all you your accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fork the source and compile locally Issues need to be submitted on Github  followed by common sense troubleshooting  leading up to retrieving the logs yourself.
FEATURE REQUEST
For the next update you could add in a widget  that would be great!
FEATURE REQUEST
A way to refresh only on demand would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Am i missing something?
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add oauth for admob
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to see both.
FEATURE REQUEST
Dev always updating when api change is required.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does what it says But could be improved.
FEATURE REQUEST
That is  you can add switches before the address that will get executed with the scan.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hard to get nmap working still This helped with the binary install but i still needed to find an /etc/services file and even then you need other files for proper scans and any UDP stuff.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only thing I'm missing is an option to change status bar's current weather icon to current temperature icon!
FEATURE REQUEST
The built in skin should be changed to show the temp in the notification area at the top like the others  don't make the notification disappear when changing skin options  and don't give black as an option if it won't show up (stick to default colors I guess).
FEATURE REQUEST
Good start could be better I have sent a few texts but it is very temperamental.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have now lost my Fish balance and there is no clear way on how to reconnect.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to store so you can resend.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I try to send message  it FC.
FEATURE REQUEST
Material design would be nice though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  it has saved me so much credit and it's a great reminder when I need to top up
FEATURE REQUEST
Need it to work on Windows 7 or 8!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Works Great Just what I needed to replace the remote a had!
FEATURE REQUEST
Laser option should have one click button
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see the timer displayed in detail at all times and remove the ""NOTES"" heading.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to have a built in pointer and a constantly visible preview slide  and it would help if the pane view started from or at least included the current slide  but it's still an outstanding app.It's got a pointer now!
FEATURE REQUEST
It's such a pleasure to think ""hey  I wish there was an app to do exactly what I need""  and then find this one!
FEATURE REQUEST
All cool just needs better UI design
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app Very good as it is now  but it would be even better if the activation of the pointer was activated by a long press the mobile screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to carry a remote presenter.
FEATURE REQUEST
not helpful for non rooted device should have a free version for trying.
FEATURE REQUEST
If this is the case  then the proper non-standard uninstall procedure should be DOCUMENTED  and it is not.
FEATURE REQUEST
Useless without root It should be stated in advance that this app does virtually nothing without root access.
FEATURE REQUEST
People who leave 1 star because of own stupidity is gross I have used this app for years  and after reading 1 star reviews because the user is too stupid to know the first thing about Android  I had to leave my 5 stars so that developer gets the credit he deserves
FEATURE REQUEST
If you know how to ise the info displayed you won't regret using this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
People are stupid Of course you need to root to see raw  low level data about exactly what apps are using your battery and why.
FEATURE REQUEST
publisher needs to highlight the ROOT REQUIRED statement  it's kind of lost in the text.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs root Bought the app only to find out that you need a rooted device to use it.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is trash as is  should have a clear description about being the need to root.
FEATURE REQUEST
Should also have a refund option for people that don't want to root their devices!!
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be a lottle description of what are wakelocks  what we should do with that.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ads Wish info was as big as ad that popped up.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs ROOT to be of any practical use.
FEATURE REQUEST
A refund should be made to all unrooted users.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs root permissions to do almost anything it does.
FEATURE REQUEST
IT NEED ROOT Permission!
FEATURE REQUEST
Must be rooted It needs to be made a lot more clear that this app does almost nothing unless you are rooted.
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to look for substitutes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs root It wasn't mentioned in the headline description that root is required.
FEATURE REQUEST
To everyone complaining about it needing root  it says so in the first paragraph of the description.
FEATURE REQUEST
Overrated The information it gives you is almost useless to resolve battery drain issues.
FEATURE REQUEST
Probably you need your device rooted
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs some work User UI needs to be better organized and formatted.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not going to give details as it could use a complete do over.
FEATURE REQUEST
It really provides everything you need to know what's using battery  and I like being able to set a custom reference point.
FEATURE REQUEST
Google should have this built-in
FEATURE REQUEST
Lack of visuals make massive amounts of text info an extreme eye sore.
FEATURE REQUEST
Gives you everything you could ever need to understand your phones power consumption.
FEATURE REQUEST
The primary tool I use to monitor battery usage - tells me everything I need to know.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still useful  but I can only use about 1/4 of the features.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app could be better No ota survivability sucks  wish there was a workaround.
FEATURE REQUEST
You guys should have a more user friendly option too.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish there was a Google+ community for this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Afterandroid-kitkat changed policy ans need to root   this app became useless  there are others doing better job   like ""gsam battery"" After spending money   became useless
FEATURE REQUEST
I've used for a couple of years now  but the recent UI overhaul has not only made it prettier  but far easier to see what you want to know too.
FEATURE REQUEST
File could not be read Downloaded this after trying everything else to solve my android system battery drain  caused by phone being awake all the time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Tells me what I need to know Maybe if there was some sort of tipping pop-up that would recommend what should be done to extend battery life.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I hadn't purchased this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is pretty much a 'root only' app and that should be reflected in description of app.
FEATURE REQUEST
It tells in great detail everything about my battery as well as point out what small changes I need to improve battery.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not what I needed Nope
FEATURE REQUEST
When I select the Kernel Wakelock it shows ""File Could not be Read.""
FEATURE REQUEST
Informative Simply put  it tells me everything I need to know .
FEATURE REQUEST
Best battery info app If you need some accurate useful battery stats and info  this is the app  well worth forking out the small price the developers offer it for.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could root to get the full experience.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app that anyone who needs to find a wake lock needs.
FEATURE REQUEST
Having to re install the app after every nightly is a little annoying tho wish there was a zip
FEATURE REQUEST
Sure it's a bit advanced in the sense of the info it gives (and more research is often needed to nail down what a certain result may mean) but it's worth it and excellent tool.
FEATURE REQUEST
Solved my issues Provided the info I needed to get to the bottom of my power drain issues.
FEATURE REQUEST
Definite learning curve involved here  but once you've got down the basics this app provides all the features you need to get serious about it.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app made my N5 to be unable to start For 2nd time I need to flash new ROM because of this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
The reason is that the app needs to be installed as system.
FEATURE REQUEST
Then if you try to uninstall it  the phone needs to be flashed again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needed Really breaks down what you need to address on your device
FEATURE REQUEST
However  I'm missing some features  for example a shortcut redirecting the wakelock or alarm to Google or a specific app that supports making these changes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good but Shame that you need to root the phone :-(
FEATURE REQUEST
Really helpful You might need some technical knowledge of how to use this but if you do you should be able to figure out what is using system resources and battery.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice redesign Would be nice to include a navigation drawer or even action bar tabs for navigation
FEATURE REQUEST
More data I wish there was more data  feels like something is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
From my experience every Android device has something that needs to be stopped or uninstalled and this tool tells you what.
FEATURE REQUEST
Of course  the app is completely capable  easy to use  and gives me the information I need to kill off those pesky wake locks.
FEATURE REQUEST
On KitKat upwards  this app now needs root access to do anything useful As title.
FEATURE REQUEST
BetterBatteryStats tells you everything you need to know.
FEATURE REQUEST
Usage would be easier It's a nice programme but one thing that prevents me from rating it with 5 stars is the lack of results when clicking on keep awake icon.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everyone needs this app...so useful :)
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is worth every penny and a must for developers that need to debug background services on the go.
FEATURE REQUEST
But the app would be better with something like a ""whats that?""
FEATURE REQUEST
Great  5star with added feature Would be 5 star if you add the ability to link to or kill the offending process that's wake locking
FEATURE REQUEST
Works randomly It always prompt me message said that batteryinfo service could not be contacted.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does what it says Works well  really helps find miss behaving apps that consume to much power
FEATURE REQUEST
Liked it But it just says the battery stats could not be contacted see updating to android 5.0
FEATURE REQUEST
If you ever NEED to know what is killing your battery  this is your man.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is uniquely useful  but could have a better UI and clearer instructions for less technical users.
FEATURE REQUEST
Many of the wakelocks have no information to aid in identification or elimination; the reference wiki should be expanded.
FEATURE REQUEST
Tells me everything I need to know to keep my battery life good.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great Does a great job of gathering the stats you need to figure out what's draining your battery.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I just need to figure out how to get the android system to stop doing the same.
FEATURE REQUEST
BestBatteryStats Pretty much everything you could want if you're looking for an app that actually does what it says (monitor your battery) without trying to cram in enough worthless features that your battery is worse off than when you started (every other app it seems like ).
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App All the info you need and more
FEATURE REQUEST
I've reached out to the developer to ask for help uninstalling the app and will update this review if he can provide me with an easy way to get it off.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Best app for those that need to see what's using all the battery
FEATURE REQUEST
Meh  kinda missing something important Menu's are jumbled and unorganized.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just purchased and wish I had not.
FEATURE REQUEST
I never wanted a refund; only more time to figure out what I needed to know before installing!)
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately due to changes in the Google kitkat operating system since 4.4.2 I can no longer use bbs unless rooted.
FEATURE REQUEST

INFORMATION GIVING
(new version takes longer to load selected image though thumbnail page  than it does from swiping left/right once an image is opened) This app lets me see photos sorted by when they were taken or last modified rather than having to search through folders such as various camera apps  downloads folder  screenshots  image editors and so on.
INFORMATION GIVING
Very annoying Every time youtube or something updates i have to update this and this takes a lot of storage!
INFORMATION GIVING
Don't pay for Verizon cloud.

Beautiful but Noticeable The live wallpaper looks great  but every so often when I minimize an app I'm greeted with a background with a black square on the bottom and a mini wallpaper up top.
INFORMATION GIVING
THIS IS VERY USEFUL APP FOR MANY GAMES AND OTHER APPS
INFORMATION GIVING
The volume buttons are accessible only when something plays.
INFORMATION GIVING
You should still support developers and buy the game as well so we get more games and show we want ways to play these types of games on our pc 's or phones
INFORMATION GIVING
App works as described  has no ads  and requires limited permissions.
INFORMATION GIVING

After I updated the app my progress was gone
INFORMATION GIVING
Almost there I love this app  but there is ONE THING you can do to make it better  please add a deck builder as well  after all you guys already have a lot of amazing features on this app  but to make it even better  and just mold it into the best card game app ever  which it kind of already is in my opinion  is adding a deck builder into it so that way I  and others  don't have to also download a deckbuilder along with this  when this already has a database built into it
INFORMATION GIVING
The old version (V1.1) didn't have such problem
INFORMATION GIVING
Great app Its a wonderful app but setting for password missing
INFORMATION GIVING
Good and quick  an ad blocker in the built in browser would make it perfect.

But a trustworthy developer not just trying to push ads or scrape data...picking your own playing time would make a huge difference.

Yes  it's a rather geeky app and you need to have a telnet client  such as the command line one Windows comes with that you can get in ""Turn Windows features on or off""  or PuTTY.,FEATURE REQUEST,Feature/Functionality 685cd540-0aa7-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,But once you connect to it  it's very straightforward to use.,OTHER,Feature/Functionality 685cd540-0aa7-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,Just type into the terminal window and your keystrokes appear instantly on the Android device.,OTHER,Feature/Functionality-Model 685cd540-0aa7-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,If you can't figure out telnet  there's another remote keyboard app out there that uses a web interface  but you still need to enter some numbers in a browser to connect.,FEATURE REQUEST,Feature/Functionality 685cd540-0aa7-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,(Or buy a bluetooth keyboard  it's simpler still.),OTHER,Other 685cd540-0aa7-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,I prefer this one because I like the simplicity of telnet and like the ""send to PC"" button at the bottom right of the phone screen  to send whatever's in the text box to the PC.,OTHER,Feature/Functionality-GUI 685cd540-0aa7-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,It's a great way to get URLs out to a PC (or send a bunch of text up to be processed with a regex and then pasted back to the phone) while you're using Remote Keyboard.,OTHER,Other 685cd540-0aa7-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,Manual ROT-13 encryption is a strange feature to include  but alright I guess.,OTHER,Feature/Functionality 685cd540-0aa7-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,I'd really prefer if there were an option to have real encryption  either with telnet over SSL (if the user can puzzle out how to create such a connection)  or even better  SSH.

Developer says that in order to have full functionality the app should be installed as a system app.

I don't use it often but when I need it  I'm so happy that it exists :) Keep on with what you do.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you are running a bunch of apps  no matter what phone you have  you'll be able to squeeze every ounce of juice out of your phone with premium efficiently.
FEATURE REQUEST
Little more documentation with less tech friendly literature will be good to have.
FEATURE REQUEST
Extremely useful The ui could be developed and made a lot more user friendly but can't fault the data presented.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if Android just included this information.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only wish the system app could persist though ROM upgrades  like how Secure Settings works.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs more power usage definitions The breakdowns are appropriate  but it needs better defining of consumption sources.
FEATURE REQUEST
Yep Does what I need it to with excellent results
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI could be a little more intuitive but it does exactly what you need it to do.
FEATURE REQUEST
Dear Sven  please add a help link in a somewhat obvious place  and I will gladly give five stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
However when I REALLY need to get to the bottom of a battery issue BetterBatteryStats is more effective.
FEATURE REQUEST
But if you have access to all the info that this application that it can provide it is truly amazing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Although this app could use some ui improvement and better redesign layout.
FEATURE REQUEST
Much needed app.
FEATURE REQUEST
A simpler explanation can be provided for the non geeky crowd
FEATURE REQUEST
Thought it would be great I've only heard good things about this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is very helpful when it comes to battery drain analysis  but results are not self explanatory and you need to goggle details to understand real root cause.
FEATURE REQUEST
Useful I needed an app to determine in my phones and family phones were properly deep sleeping when they are doing nothing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app But it needs to be a bit more robust.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great battery monitor tool Needs a bit of savvy tech to understand how to use effectively.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent Only thing that would be better was if the wake locks that it so awesomely detects had links as to what they were and what to do about them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent app You need to do some tweaks to work correctly with cm kit Kat roms.except that awesome app
FEATURE REQUEST
Extremely useful Would be good to include common details on wakelocks to aid with problem solving.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you are ever experiencing battery problems and can not nail down the cause  you need this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app before KitKat Have used for years  but Google changes mean you need to root to get the useful features working: partial wake locks etc.
FEATURE REQUEST

How can the designers of one of the best sites do such a terrible job with a phone app?

FEATURE REQUEST
Usefull I would say it is useful in a way if a person need to do research it is much easier on app than going to the site
FEATURE REQUEST
Language Plz add Hindi or Marathi language in this app
FEATURE REQUEST
Really wish there was a way to dismiss sections I have no interest in I have zero interest in what articles are ""trending"".
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish that there was a way to get that section turned off permanently.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be much better if I can save opened files or my search results in PDF or in other formats to share with my friends who does not have access to Internet.
FEATURE REQUEST
Saved pages Hey  can you make a new feature where you can sync your saved pages?
FEATURE REQUEST
My phone recently reformatted  and I have to resave forty pages when I reinstalled the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Trending 馃憥 I wish I could close it for good.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excelent One of the best app that I have use I suggest every one to get this app
FEATURE REQUEST
Holding all of it's authors accountable  while at the same time pointing out where further proof is needed or required  or where further information is needed  gives it unmatched credibility while demanding facts and not opinions.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need little changes It would be better to have a ""forgot password"" option while logging in.
FEATURE REQUEST
But there should be more information about ""how the human eye works""
FEATURE REQUEST
I live in Johannesburg  South Africa  and I think your information needs updating.
FEATURE REQUEST
Why are these necessary?
FEATURE REQUEST
Its Awesome but need some more features
FEATURE REQUEST
Conserveapedia had to be created because reality has a liberal bias.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love wikipedia  but the app needs cloud sync Its difficult for anyone that uses multiples devices throughout the day.
FEATURE REQUEST
nice but need some fixes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wikipedia Great information and links to explain issues that need further clarification!
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't know but i thik something is missing
FEATURE REQUEST
Brilliant what started as a simple wikipidia app with lots of missing features has turned now into a fantastic app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app It's very good app  but need to increase more pages to save in offline mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing enhancement - Themes (for the great app/Knowledge Basis) There are just 2 options of themes.
FEATURE REQUEST
For me  the articles suggest new topics of the Unimaginable Knowledge.
FEATURE REQUEST
You can get every answer but you just need to search correctly.
FEATURE REQUEST
Copy    share   these options not working..need to fix some issues
FEATURE REQUEST
Also it would be nice if instead of selecting pages one by one it would download all pages linked from a particular page for offline use.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but missing reading lists sync Will it ever be possible to sync reading lists between devices?
FEATURE REQUEST
That would be nice!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but missing important feature App is good but one important feature must be added to it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wikipedia must be programmed that if one logins his account the saved pages called reading list must be backed up.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is the Guide This app should be necessary for every device.
FEATURE REQUEST
The reason I got my first smartphone I just wish Douglas Adams was here to see the Hitchiker's Guide come to life.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome  but Need some fixes.
FEATURE REQUEST
You are deva and I know you can do better like you can add cloud sync as I change my device I have to re-save the pages again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wikipedia is my go-to app when I need information.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  but the search function needs work Overall  I am pleased with the app  but I've noticed that sometimes when I search for an article the top results are not for the article I want  even when I correctly type the exact name of the article I'm searching for into the search bar.
FEATURE REQUEST
Saving feature is also nice to access some pages when offline; perhaps it could be even better if that feature would be linked to the account so I could have the same pages across devices or get back on clean reinstall.
FEATURE REQUEST
Improve it Improve it by adding night mode option .
FEATURE REQUEST
Good This is short I Need more information
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be great to be able to customize your home screen so you only see what you want  and be able to access your reading lists on the website.
FEATURE REQUEST
(hundreds) It would be nice  if these links could be backed up or stored in my account on your server.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app need to know some thing this app all answers
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add multi window support?
FEATURE REQUEST
However you might receive a few more donations if you add an option to remove the dreadful  intrusive ""cards"" from the front-end of the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app It will be great to add option for saving a page offline
FEATURE REQUEST
Used to love Wikipedia and would give donations  now I can barely use the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would suggest not to download this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very nice This is really good app  but it have some little bugs and missing some options.
FEATURE REQUEST
It need connection It always told Tom Retry retry dose not work at all it is not offline app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to fix that.
FEATURE REQUEST
PLEASE MAKE NEW OFFLINE WIKIPEDIA APP FOR INDIA MAINLY CONTAINING ALL INDIA RELATED PDF PLEASE ADD NEW FEATURE OF DOWNLOADING WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE IN PDF IN DOWNLOAD LOCATION EXTERNAL SD CARD SERIOUSLY .

Just need one more option which will allow us to download the whole article as formatted pdf or epun  there must be outlined bookmarks/table of contents in the converted pdf/epub!
FEATURE REQUEST
if you add this feature the app will be one of the greatest apps!
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesomeness It is good app having so much detail   but some of topics need to update the news of latest version .
FEATURE REQUEST
Worthy app I can found easily all the meanings whatever I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
App is nice and simple AND makes a decent attempt at Material Design  but that still needs some tweaking.
FEATURE REQUEST
At the very least  *please* allow the user to customize what appears on this screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
perfect this is the best app i ever used for studying i always need my phone to study coz there are many thing that aren't given in the book.
FEATURE REQUEST
So adding a feature like that would be beneficial and effective for readers.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very useful  I need it!
FEATURE REQUEST
no offline view it should have offline option so we can see the info we browse before.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could give negative stars When helping my son look some stuff up the featured article's card had porn on the cover photo.
FEATURE REQUEST
#great app It is great need much improvement for lite version.
FEATURE REQUEST
Crashing when adding articles to reading list The app frequently crashes when I add an article to my reading list.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes I mistake save page  I need to remove it but I can't.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best y'all don't wanna miss this app
FEATURE REQUEST
When can you provide an option to charge it back to the previous one?
FEATURE REQUEST
but can be improved like a bit slow now and also few things can be added like highlight the texts in offline mode etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent If you just could add night mode to it  it would be great!
FEATURE REQUEST
so we should use this app for everything.
FEATURE REQUEST
The previous version was much better The previous one had the option of searching for a particular saved page.It is inconvenient to search for a particular page among many.And it would be better if the images of saved pages also loaded properly each and every time in offline mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
I NEED you to bring back linking directly to the IMDB app.
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
A widget would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Difficult to view threads Also nice would be possibility to move all data to sim card in one go
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to have a prompt to resize photo when sending as attachment.
FEATURE REQUEST
K9 Robust and Stable Now the only I would suggest is a simpler way of deleting multiple email mainly spam email which is long and annoying to delete one by one.
FEATURE REQUEST
When you try to contact K-9 support you get a message that tells you that any message to that address will be ignored.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only way to get help is through their forum and nobody replies.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good 5 stars if it can be added as full screen Email app widget
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish the unified inbox worked Sadly  the unified inbox feature more likely works as a ""unified everything including trash"" folder  which somehow defeats one of the reasons to have a separate email app (unless I missed something).
FEATURE REQUEST
Suggestion It would be really useful if this app had the ability to share an email with another app such as the Android stock calendar  or a-calendar  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Unlimited font scaling is available in some apps - would be good in K9 also.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app needs a professional UI redesign by someone with some UX / design background.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it would be great if I could save male to a folders.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need more password encryption options This app only supports MD5 encrypted passwords  and I need SHA512
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Mail App Wish it would open pictures with out tapping  show pictures
FEATURE REQUEST
Since i need to be notified of emails as they come in  this makes the app useless to me.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only solution I've found is to delete the application completely  reinstall  and setup the accounts all over again.
FEATURE REQUEST
But why there is no reply button at wide screen?
FEATURE REQUEST
Free from ads and does what I need most.
FEATURE REQUEST
I uninstalled it because I need my mail app to be more dependable than that.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would just like an addition  for POP  that new folders could be made and emails could be moved to them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love this app I would just like to be able to delete several messages at a time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Been using K9 for nearly 4 years now very user friendly and has performed all what such App should have.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  right now it allow mail movement to another folders within the same email ID but it would be better if it allow mails to be able to move from different email ID.
FEATURE REQUEST
Client certificate with auth with password I need to use a client cert AND a password for my imap.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't need to be alerted of this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty slick I wish I'd found it sooner.
FEATURE REQUEST
Push isn't reliable When the display is off for a couple of hours  push notifications aren't sent any more and a manual poll has to be done to resolve the issue.
FEATURE REQUEST
it does however need a multi-delete option as it's pain deleting emails one by one  and there needs to be font options for sent emails.
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI could be modernised as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish I could use all my accounts with it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed rich text signature in order to use this app with my companies logo on every email.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish this could be fixed because I really liked this app!
FEATURE REQUEST
Love K-9  HATE the lack of widget support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish this existed for desktop PC as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing is Exchange 2010 & 365 support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Works as expected very well written and I wish I can give you more stars good job.
FEATURE REQUEST
Solution was to disable background data for this app which means it won't do push email on mobile  but this is a small price to pay to have the phone behave.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm only missing a setting to sign emails per default with a certain default key.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks S/MIME feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still the best  but really needs an overhaul.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good But Needs PGP/MIME K-9 works well with OpenKeychain  but doesn't seem to support PGP/MIME-formatted email that Thunderbird with Enigmail produces.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Would like to see the ability to use a save9 as or save to Dropbox
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to juggle a half dozen accounts and the app handles it better than every other app I've tried.
FEATURE REQUEST
Did work  or so I believed This classifies some of my emails as SPAM  so they miss my inbox!?
FEATURE REQUEST
Application need new look.This ui don't looks good!
FEATURE REQUEST
Not working Keeps saying my username or password is wrong when i try adding my email.
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to ""update"" it  in my opinion.
FEATURE REQUEST
Functional & Reliable NEEDS CONVERSATION VIEW as well as MATERIAL DESIGN update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was easier instructions.
FEATURE REQUEST
This can be fixed only by application force stop.
FEATURE REQUEST
My only issue is when selecting a contact to send to  it always shows the error 'no email address could be found for this contact' - though they all had emails defined!
FEATURE REQUEST
I often have more than 25 messages  and k9 deletes some that I need to save.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there a way to force a message to remain in my inbox forever?
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be good if there was a similar Chrome app that cached IMAP data locally.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a better app to use.
FEATURE REQUEST
K9 Very good  wish there was a Linux version.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish there was a way to make it the default email app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good basic email app If you need a pretty design  this is not the app for you.
FEATURE REQUEST
My favourite mail client If you make a paid version and add exchange functionality  I would buy it in a heartbeat.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nearly perfect Nearly perfect  but needs PGP S/MIME.
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI needs to be brought into modern times.
FEATURE REQUEST
No printing option Please add printing option to app menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
The best email app I can find Wish I could set up a spam folder with xfinity.
FEATURE REQUEST
Doesn't accept exchange server Keeps saying the URL is not valid although it works with every other Android mail app I've tried do far.
FEATURE REQUEST
Another desirable feature would be a rapid delete gesture and an undo button for the last move/delete action.
FEATURE REQUEST
It actually does what you want it to  not what some spotty developer thinks you should have.
FEATURE REQUEST
what is missing k9 mail should have it's own address book!
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice App Would be awesome app if could do folders on pop accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it feels like it needs an interface overhaul.
FEATURE REQUEST
Configurable  versatile  does all I need(multiple email accounts).
FEATURE REQUEST
It have all what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI is sometimes a bit clumsy to use and could use a make over.
FEATURE REQUEST
I also wish I could configure filters to automatically sort my mail into folders.
FEATURE REQUEST
just what you need an email client for your emails
FEATURE REQUEST
then I had to switch because of wrong dates (and therefore sorting) on some messages  lack of swipes  a crash constantly occurring when receiving some type of messages (probably malformed but no other client I have tried crashed because of that)  and missing features in notifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
UNINSTALLED: Hoping that this would be a good replacement for the email client that came with the phone  However  when I tried to set it up  both Google and Yahoo servers complained about the lack of security.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but lacking a quick reply.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have used K9 for over a year and then I switched to Blue Mail due to the fact it has a very easy to use feature for quick replies which is something that K9 completely Lacks being someone that uses email for business I have a very high need for quick replies because I get asked the same questions all the time add this feature and this is a 5 Star program...without it  average
FEATURE REQUEST
Best Android mail client  lacks important feature hands-down  this is the best Android mail client.
FEATURE REQUEST
*** UPDATE: Having just changed cell phones  I've had to downgrade my rating because it lacks a way to transfer sent mail between devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Swipe action for delete and mark read and an indication of which inbox I'm looking at would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Customizable and simple to use (though not to tune it up :)))) Also I'd suggest changing the app logo  wouldn't it be better to make something more like an envelope and less like a dog?
FEATURE REQUEST
That icon is missing on the top of the screen and only visible on the bottom when held in portrait.
FEATURE REQUEST
you realize that there's no way to undelete messages for pop3 accounts and that messages that you definitely never ever touched end up in the trash folder (probably when they get purged on the server  which should have nothing to do with the contents of local pop3 folders).
FEATURE REQUEST
THAT IS ALL THAT'S MISSING!
FEATURE REQUEST
wish there was a mail reader this powerful for my iPad.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good email client  but can be better I like K-9 Email  but the UI needs some improvement.
FEATURE REQUEST
One of the features I am missing particularly is splitting message list and message content panes vertically on top of each other.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is a way to contact the developer  but it is too complicated for me.
FEATURE REQUEST
The GUI is too old  needs changing Been using K9mail since day one.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  there should be a choice where to store the emails and not just downloads.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best email app 2-21-2016: is there a way to print an email like I print pdf files?
FEATURE REQUEST
Suddenly  this app now removes any attachments I add to emails.
FEATURE REQUEST
It Works It works  but I can't figure out how to add more than one account  and it would be nice if you could add custom folders.
FEATURE REQUEST
AndrewM Edit: I would like to upgrade my rating  but you need to address this issue first.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Exchange 2010
FEATURE REQUEST
I would give 5 stars if there was a way to move emails from the delete folder back into the inbox folder.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was a way to search all emails through app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Okay but lacks a critical interface.
FEATURE REQUEST
Delete The app is great and I use it for work constantly the one complaint I do have is that the delete button needs to be moved from the center of the bottom row.
FEATURE REQUEST
Made me miss some really important emails.
FEATURE REQUEST
feature request:optionally one additional password for launching the android app one should be optionally be able to set an additional local password just to launch the k9 android app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing emails?
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is just what I needed to get all my email organised the way I want.
FEATURE REQUEST
great overall  lacks a few bells & whistles needs to have inline image inserts and text formatting
FEATURE REQUEST
Some changes in the folder list are non reversible but and if you do any mistake you may need to delete and add again the account.
FEATURE REQUEST
Had 1 minor issue which I resolved using the online help.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to rename and reorder folders.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to be able to customise the LED color though
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish its icon is updated to current trends
FEATURE REQUEST
It might not be related to K-9.
FEATURE REQUEST
This ""move mail"" function is so needed to make this a 5 star app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had labels.
FEATURE REQUEST
Manual sorting is missing This is a great app  I use it everyday.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if one can sort folders manually and select for syncing.
FEATURE REQUEST
But the only feature that is missing is access protection.
FEATURE REQUEST
I am calling on the dev to add a password on start   or for another developer to make a plugin to add this missing important feature to K9 mail.
FEATURE REQUEST
(Chrome OS is lacking a complete email client for combining email accounts.)
FEATURE REQUEST
I would dearly love to see this wonderful app updated to resolve these problems.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs a serious maintenance update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Swipe function Really like this app but would be 5* awesome if in the next release you could add a swipe to delete function and a number by the desktop icon saying how many new emails have arrived.
FEATURE REQUEST
My only issue is that this needs a little menu button in game  as android tablets don't have em for some reason and hence I can't save my states.
FEATURE REQUEST
I miss playing these old point and click adventure games.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no way to get a keyboard and enter some costum values.
FEATURE REQUEST
Kyra is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
If this could be fixed I would rate this app 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
The sound for the Discworld game has become strange and it says it's missing an instrument?!
FEATURE REQUEST
A little help Please add the support of the minigames in green eggs and ham in the next update
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish you had a stronger partnership with GOG or some companies like that to bring the pleasure of great games on mobile devices to everyone!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  could be better Cannot summon keyboard for Monkey Island 2 on Galaxy S5.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it Wish I knew about it years ago.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great......but I give this one star because although most of the games played fine there are a few that need a keyboard to play fully and sadly this version doesn't have a keyboard feature so until it does my rating will stay the same
FEATURE REQUEST
Wonderful A great emulator that runs gorgeous games you missed to play.
FEATURE REQUEST
3 which is listed incompatable (there is a way to get it 2 work).
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish it would rotate on my tablet.
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
If anyone could help with this problem that would be great and I'd gladly give it 5 stars if it would work
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
Hope it gets fixed in an update as I miss playing the non Directors cut of Broken Sword.
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
Go to 'options' then 'midi' and make sure 'mixed adlib/midi mode' is checked then restart Scummvm and direct touch should be enabled.
FEATURE REQUEST
Performance Some battery power consumption optimization would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is especially difficult when one needs to use the scroll buttons to select game paths within the emulator's interface.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some games don't save  and I wish the UI was better  still it is awesome if you don't mind reading readme files.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs sound and video options like PC Glad to be back up to the latest version.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to have a proper option for touch interface and not the adlib-midi tick box bodge

FEATURE REQUEST
I miss playing Monkey Island as a time killer.
FEATURE REQUEST
Downloaded the demo for Full Throttle and played  though I needed to bluetooth a keyboard to get it to work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I need to find a demo for Dig.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but needs some improvement I really enjoy this app-brings back memories and relives some good masterpieces like ""I have no mouth and I must scream"" and also the broken sword games but you guys should seriously fix that start up glitch as it can take forever to load.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think I should also add that for some reason or another there's this crazy lag with any game I play with it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needed to play Dreamweb and this does the job nicely so far.
FEATURE REQUEST
You'll need to download the correct plugins to add support for certain games or series.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you add more games later  then download the appropriate plugins as you need them.
FEATURE REQUEST
So now I need to use it.

FEATURE REQUEST
Cool security feature Would like to see a option for a notification like the one that steam has.
FEATURE REQUEST
google please add the account syncing capablities.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  I should be able to secure the app with a code or fingerprint.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only reason I tried is you can only use one device with LastPass Authenticator.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing phones?
FEATURE REQUEST
other than that I would love to try the app out  but I'm worried if I lost the phone or the phone is damaged or if I get a new phone I would not be able to get into my Google account
FEATURE REQUEST
Really if a service you use offers two factor authentication  you should use it  and this app is used for at least a few non Google 2fa systems.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be an option to approve the sign-in request within the app itself  just like how the Microsoft Account app is doing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Integrated scanner a plus not that impressed wish I had not updated
FEATURE REQUEST
Profile photo Please add profile picture for each account so we won't get confused with multiple accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good I NEED THIS FOR MAKE NEW ID SFOR COC
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  could be made better with fingerprint unlocking Not sure why Google's own apps fall behind its own technology  but it would be great if this app could be locked and you could use your PIN or fingerprint to unlock it
FEATURE REQUEST
It's good but a simple ""approve"" or ""deny"" button would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
That's why I don't use automatic app update and read reviews before update !
FEATURE REQUEST
Better add roll back to previous version option in the phone  developers !!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Security Please add password to open this application.
FEATURE REQUEST
Finger print support Please add this feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
So my phone needed to be reset.
FEATURE REQUEST
Find that to be superior since if I lose my phone I will still be able to recover my account by transferring the number.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very nice secure Must be enabled by everyone in today's digi world.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is NO WAY to transfer all your accounts from one device to another when you get a new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no way to contact Google or even post on the Product Forums site.
FEATURE REQUEST
How could you make a so simple app get worse?
FEATURE REQUEST
And now I can not add more then 4 sites before I need to scroll but with no reason!!
FEATURE REQUEST
wish you could utilize two factor authentication on multiple devices with the same code.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to offer a way to move to a new device with < 30' of work.
FEATURE REQUEST
The way it is this app should be withdrawn.
FEATURE REQUEST
Will give 5 stars if they add a cloud backup or transfer option to migrate codes to new device
FEATURE REQUEST
I have challenge in getting the sms code  I tried to verify my number but the reply is always invalid number  I need to access my account urgently please I need help
FEATURE REQUEST
Well I accidentally reinstall this app  and need to set it back.
FEATURE REQUEST
So i need to contact the provider and wait for code.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to find out all the scan bar and the scan bar can't scan in gallery!
FEATURE REQUEST
Two small improvements This needs the ability to group together entries (e.g.  work  email  games)  and the ability to search/filter.
FEATURE REQUEST
Must have App you should have it and use it to keep your accounts from getting hacked.
FEATURE REQUEST
Why the app doesn't send a prompt whenever I try to sign in?
FEATURE REQUEST
limited options I need to transfer my old account to my new phone but can't do it there should be a code that will generate from your old device that you enter on new phone or take a picture of code with your new phone from you old phone
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to keep backup on drive Great app.
FEATURE REQUEST
It will be more useful when start keeping backup of codes on Google drive and keep sync with other devices installed with same account.
FEATURE REQUEST
The + sign to add another item obscures the count down icon of one item so need to move the screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  the one feature it is missing is that there is no ability to reorder your codes  which is particularly annoying.
FEATURE REQUEST
An option to customise the font sizes would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the look could be reverted.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Wish they could make an OFFICIAL desktop version.
FEATURE REQUEST
now I need to scroll while before never.
FEATURE REQUEST
This used to be very good now it's horrible and needs constant scrolling to find anything.
FEATURE REQUEST
I Need The Google Accout It Is Very Important.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not secure enough It needs a pin code.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app  but lacks features Used this for years  but the deal breaker for me was the lack of backup options for my 2FA entries.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to have an option to backup to the cloud (securely) and be able to restore to another device should my primary device fail.
FEATURE REQUEST
Easy to use  simple to set up I have been using this app for over a month now and only wish my bank would accept 2FA.
FEATURE REQUEST
They both always ask me for a 6-digit code and the only two ways to get this code is to scan a bar code or manually add an account with the 'account name' and then 'key'.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't understand why you would want to create so much wasted space.
FEATURE REQUEST
Careful with this When it updates and decides to remove your keys you will be completely locked out of every account you need this app for.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you make it use less space it looks like a lot of empty space is lost in the new layout.
FEATURE REQUEST
Total crap You made me spend at least an hour to figure out on my own how to get it to work again  and I missed being able to print out resumes at Kinkos for a job fair.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add logos Would be nice to add icons for each system being logged into.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I need a magnifying glass just to see my token.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have 12 different accounts  and I need a second set of thumbs just to scroll through the list.
FEATURE REQUEST
-- Previous review -- Would be really nice to bring back the dark theme  or at least let me choose the theme.
FEATURE REQUEST
The ""new"" material interface has A LOT of unoccupied space which could be used to actually fit another account on screen (please don't call this a security feature).
FEATURE REQUEST
Need a way to transfer from one phone to another If I changed my phone  then I have no option to transfer my details to new phone
FEATURE REQUEST
Can someone at google actually try installing the app and do a quick test before releasing it?
FEATURE REQUEST
...whoever made the decision to shrink the count down timer (to a little tiny dot) should be kicked off the dev team.
FEATURE REQUEST
Plss add sync account with gmail If this app have gmail account linked for example i lost my mobile then want get back all linked account details back then it will very useful for all user
FEATURE REQUEST
Urgently needs backup  restore and sync functionality.
FEATURE REQUEST
Updated version have resolved many issues and added me features 馃槂 Wow!
FEATURE REQUEST
The core functionality is still there  and if all you have is 1-4 accounts that need codes  then it will work great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I need to scroll down to get to my passwords.
FEATURE REQUEST
Protected It should have a password/pin for this app
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if Hangouts could have this dark themes too.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you are on the same google account  with the same phone number as before  you should be able to sync with the other accounts you had on the authenticator.
FEATURE REQUEST
I had 2-step verification with my bank account  and now I can't log in because it needs a code.
FEATURE REQUEST
But the only way for me to get codes in the app on the new phone is to re-add the bank account  which I can't do because I need to be logged in to my online banking in order to generate a barcode or key.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's frustrating to scroll through the list  especially when we could easily have a font size option as well as compact themes to reduce whitespace.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but lacks one feature!
FEATURE REQUEST
Need a backup option I'm not sure why  I'm not a security expert but there should be a backup option in case you loose your phone or get a new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need custom icons and ability to set both text entries Hard to find what you want and would like to completely control what title text is shown (still stuck with the default text set)
FEATURE REQUEST
I should be able to scan a barcode displayed on the screen   it would make signing in easier.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish I could use this everywhere!
FEATURE REQUEST
sometimes we do need to access our account through the phone's browser.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm missing the option to rearrange codes.
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to send a confirmation code to one's account.
FEATURE REQUEST
Finally  a good update  but it still needs work.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the Android version had a widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
this app needs fingerprint support
FEATURE REQUEST
When will we be able to import/export?
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs Reorder Option / Dark Background This app could really use the ability to sort/reorder entries  as well as the option to use a dark background as before.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add This would be a great app if it could be used everywhere  not just with my Google account.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add widget support Your android wear support is 10/10 make a battery preserving widget that you need to touch to refresh and that's it  5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
unable to use app during setup on enter key provided screen what key I need to enter is not clear.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add a widget Please add a widget for easier access to the code on the go.
FEATURE REQUEST
Having this feature integrated would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Works perfectly but would be better if the clock synced automatically when the app is started.
FEATURE REQUEST
C'mon Google  I need to move my old accounts to a new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing group creation and list ordering.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add widget  so we can show our code anytime.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sorry if I'm not polite comparing one product to another  but I and a lot of my friends need that.
FEATURE REQUEST
Meanwhile Google still makes me go to the app  read the number  type the number into the device I need it on.
FEATURE REQUEST
Google needs to catch up.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is most required application but i have some concerns regarding the security
FEATURE REQUEST
Add push notif please I'm tired typing those number every time I want to log in to a site  would be great if you simplify with just push notifications  and I just tap accept  and logged in.
FEATURE REQUEST
This needs fixing!
FEATURE REQUEST
For added security For added security  this app should have a password to open.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs an option for a PIN to be set up.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to run this app permission
FEATURE REQUEST
New Mobile If you change your phone you need to contact the support to delete your google authentifikator because you can't swich it to your new mobile
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to be How Manny number like say short when it's long an when it's long it's not good nuff
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to get this app
FEATURE REQUEST
please add to app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just don't use th Gmail app use ur browser to open ur gmail that way u CAN sign-out.
FEATURE REQUEST
The problem with 1 was I needed the code from this app to be able to login to the account to get the qr or key needed to add the account again to the new phone...obviously not possible.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app You need this in this day and age.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just hope there would be more platforms using it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sync and use of the camera api for scanning qr codes needed Needs to ditch the need for a 3rd party app to scan qr codes
FEATURE REQUEST
need two device and im sign in no work updates wtf
FEATURE REQUEST
Well done Google  wanna be secure when its inconvenient for the user but too lazy to encrypt what you are trying to protect.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a way to change the theme to dark.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love the app  but you really need to update from holo to material design.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Holding off updating due to reports that a 3rd party qr reader is required
FEATURE REQUEST
The only feature missing is changing the order of accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Doesn't scan QR codes It doesn't ask for any permissions to camera and when trying to scan a code  it doesn't detect at all
FEATURE REQUEST
Mr I need money
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Works as needed but missing key features.
FEATURE REQUEST
The ui needs an update  it doesn't have a secure integrated camera  and doesn't allow one click authentication requests like lastpass.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I enter the code provided the app on the computer after trying to enable the authenticator  it tells me that the code is not correct  I have tried it 3 times after deleting the account from the app and even reinstalled it  but it keeps telling me that the code is invalid so the account will not recognize that the authenticator was installed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Broken camera functionality Everytime I try to use this app it says the camera failed and I need to restart my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everything else is great but why push notifications is missing?
FEATURE REQUEST
Works Would be nice to edit the title of entries though - some sites don't set it right.
FEATURE REQUEST
2 step Great back up App to the security codes you need to print & save from your gmail account.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still holding off on update Lack of dark theme is a no go for me  so I won't be updating until that returns.
FEATURE REQUEST
DJ Lame At First Until I Needed It Haha thanx Google
FEATURE REQUEST
It's a must have for everyone who needs added security for your accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
If my phone gets stolen and hacked into  you just handed them 3 out of the 4 pieces of information they need to hack into the account I put into Google Authenticator.
FEATURE REQUEST
It will not work  and so this is a bullshit app  that can't get you into your account when you need it to work!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
what can i do ?
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add the copy and paste feature similar to iOS here in android?
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app for what's there  wish I didn't have to install a 3rd-party barcode scanner though - a built-in scanner in Android would be much better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Useful  but missing some features Helps make things more secure  but I wish it would sync my accounts to the Google backup system.
FEATURE REQUEST
There are other qr code readers that only need the camera  but they don't work with Google Authenticator.
FEATURE REQUEST
Google needs to build in a QR code reader or use something else more reputable.
FEATURE REQUEST
U guys should have built-in the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Edit- in comparison with other similar application this ones lacks a lot so 2 star.
FEATURE REQUEST
There must be some way to sync the accounts which are added in this app so after factory reset we don't have to re-set up all accounts again.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't need it for OTPs  just adding U2F support  but it still works great
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish more sites and services would support 2 step authentication with this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
A widget would be cool.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is a great app for adding an extra layer of security .
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I can rearrange the order of the codes after adding them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fix this before my android phone completely dies  as it has the only authenticator that works and I need to switch devices now!
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing many important features like online sync.
FEATURE REQUEST
Instant approval feature is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Security code need to be entered to verify.
FEATURE REQUEST
Trying to set it up Spent 20 min trying to get the app to scan the barcode needed to set it up but it just not reading it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also a proper Material Design look would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
No rival to Authy I hope they put a bit more effort into it and add more features soon.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pointless Says I need a code but hasn't given me a code to use and now has stopped me logging into fifa saying I need a code the app won't give me as I now can't log in.
FEATURE REQUEST
After downloadung this app  you need to install another barcode reader with ugly looking icon taking up another slot in app drawer.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need extra protection Please add some extra protection like 4 digits passcode etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be better if there was initial authentication required - like a fingerprint to prevent unauthorised access to the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wished it saved everything!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Only way to solve the issue is to remove authentication.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice This is handy for when I don't have reception on my phone and I need to log in to my Google account  it's good for people with 2-step verification
FEATURE REQUEST
You only need it one time when you sign in from a new device.
FEATURE REQUEST
It does its job well  but the ability to sort and / or reorder all the accounts I've set up would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sync with android wear needs to improve
FEATURE REQUEST
You need this Love what it does.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is frustrating when you need to re-sync within 24 hours  especially if it is an account that requires 2FA re-login every 24 hours.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there's backup option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Saved codes should be able to be rearranged.
FEATURE REQUEST
After adding a bunch of codes I find that the one I use the most is lost in the middle and would be nice to have on top.
FEATURE REQUEST
A night theme would also be nice as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great ...but would REALLY like to be able to change the order of the accounts on the authenticator screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Got a new phone and there is no logical way of signing into my account.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can't restore my generated verification codes Hi  i want to know what can the person do if he lose his phone which he had installed Google authenticator on it to generate verification codes for logging into his accounts in some important sites  as if he couldn't get the right verification code sequence he won't be able to login to his accounts any more?
FEATURE REQUEST
Switch Phones Hope you don't need to move to a new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good But would be even better  if an app had the ability to rearrange and sort accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
me need dark theme
FEATURE REQUEST
Passcode The app would be much better if there was an option to set a passcode (requested every time you launch the app).
FEATURE REQUEST
You cannot reorder accounts  so add them into the app in priority order.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing PIN to open Waiting for PIN to open and backup to Google drive for 5 star.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great added security Would be 5鈽?if there was a widget
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it wish it had a better ui I mean pleasant to the eye
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs a black theme for AMOLED displays.
FEATURE REQUEST
The digits should be split into groups of three.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great 2FA app Just needs support at more sites
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could name them myself  and drag to reorder.
FEATURE REQUEST
Anytime I need to validate sign in a phone notification would pop up and all I need to do hit approve or deny signin.
FEATURE REQUEST
It working Need more speed finder
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if one could backup the private keys
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make a widget for this?
FEATURE REQUEST
Cannot use this without an option to backup data  if you format ur phone  you will not be able to access anything  backup and restore database should be here
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Please  add a button shortcut to copy the code fast.
FEATURE REQUEST
Suggestion Please add a way to get the code in the notification bar or think of a wY where we don't have to open up the app  copy the code and paste it.
FEATURE REQUEST
it does work good but it wonders more about how secure could it be  are only registered devices elegible to gain codes to access an account  it would be better if more companies offered usb security keys or portable usb fingerprint scanners registered to the devices  it is harder to misplace a key than a phone which can be broken  stolen  or hacked by 3rd party tech.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be better if it worked with wear
FEATURE REQUEST
This should be made inbuilt app for all android phones
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  but we really need manual reordering!
FEATURE REQUEST
Thank goodness my old phone still has the old version of this app on it otherwise I wouldn't be able to get on my own email
FEATURE REQUEST
After seeing that you'd given some UI attention to this app I was hoping the app would be changed so that I only need to tap my code to copy it instead of tap & hold and then tap a copy button.
FEATURE REQUEST
For those of us who have to switch phones once and a while  it sure would be nice to not have to set up your 2FA all over again.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I tried to put the authenticator on my computer  it opted to send the app to my old phone company.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs a widget Other auth token apps seem to all have widgets so it isn't necessary to open the full app to get your code.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really wish this app had a widget as I find it irritating to have to open the app every time I need a token.
FEATURE REQUEST
To use barcode scanner  you will need to install a third party app Why there isnt a built in scanner?
FEATURE REQUEST
Initiated To develop interface it is required to speak to iti
FEATURE REQUEST
Roman Ahamed Dr.sir  I am a beautiful person  and a new job on my phone Samsung galaxy s2 GT -19105P know your system  reviews on the phone add the rate of interest.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'll use it when you add your own barcode scanner This app tries to force you to use a 3rd party barcode scanner.
FEATURE REQUEST
Poor Copying  Missing Proper App Sharing I should just have to tap a code once to copy to clipboard.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty awesome that you can use this as an authenticator for other apps like Guild Wars 2 as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great and easily used with other applications but misses pin/fingerprint protection to access codes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ok  the App is fine  but it really needs one very simple addition: Rearranging the codes!
FEATURE REQUEST
You might need to restart your device.""
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great to have: - pin/fingerprint to open app or display codes - cloud backup when upgrading OS (from MM to N for example) or switching to a new/different device.
FEATURE REQUEST
Yes the lack of a dark theme is jarring.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish this had push notifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please Can you make it ask your email instead of your phone number for people who have a smart phone but not their sim in it?
FEATURE REQUEST
More people need to get on two step.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish it was possible to move the entries up/down in the list!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Needed by google to authenticate my account.
FEATURE REQUEST
For third parties you might be locked out until they intervene.
FEATURE REQUEST
Required Barcode Scanner doesn't work The required barcode scanner lacks the ability to ever achieve focus on a barcode on my Samsung Galaxy S4.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add ability to restack the accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ok Needs passcode lock
FEATURE REQUEST
Not working Using my Samsung tab 4 and I have not a had a right code yet not I'm locked out of all my devices wish I never got it &gt;:(
FEATURE REQUEST
Menu button missing NEW Polaroid snap phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Currently the display order is fixed in the order in which you add them.
FEATURE REQUEST
The fact that I needed to take this many steps is ridiculous.
FEATURE REQUEST
But you should add an export option!
FEATURE REQUEST
2) Even if my device uses a screen lock (passcode/fingerprint) it would be nice if the app itself required its own pincode/fingerprint prompt.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add the ability to create folders or categories  or add particular icons to entries.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  I could not end or go through all the steps needed to verify.
FEATURE REQUEST
But Needs to be able to back up accounts to use on multiple devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Features.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also when you add an Account.
FEATURE REQUEST
You are screwed if you need to update on the go.
FEATURE REQUEST
I recently updated to Android 5.0 and now it won't even open and I need this for most of my MMO accounts  so now I can't play my games because the app won't even launch anymore!
FEATURE REQUEST
i'd like to think that an easier way could be worked out  but the app does work as described.
FEATURE REQUEST
The one issue that I have is how to get to the message then back to the screen where it should be entered.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if the code could show itself on the page that's already there.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app but Its needs more security before open the app like 4 digits passcode or gesture pattern.
FEATURE REQUEST
That way even if you're home  if someone takes your phone they still need the pin to get into your account.
FEATURE REQUEST
With Authy I can use the same 2 factor setup on all the same accounts  but I can also use it on my tablet and desktop.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really like using this app  but you need to add the ability to rearrange the tiles.
FEATURE REQUEST
They appear in the order that you add them and that's it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it came preinstalled
FEATURE REQUEST
Copy to other phones Please add option to copy to other phones
FEATURE REQUEST
Finger print support Please add nexus imprint support for 5x and 6p in Android M. It's a shame that this app don't have the support.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is one app which should have fingerprint support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Otherwise anyone using (stealing) your device can use this app to access all your accounts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had a PIN/password protection Dear Google  please make this secure by allowing me to set up a PIN or password to access my codes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish all password protected services use this method of authorization!
FEATURE REQUEST
Google  could you please add the option to sort my codes alphabetically?
FEATURE REQUEST
Privacy violator Needs GPS location just to scan a barcode with the camera.
FEATURE REQUEST
5* Google play store may be accessed

Its Awesome I do wish that they would update their music.
FEATURE REQUEST
Battery killer Great app for music sometimes you don't always get the right song so a better search engine and variety would be nice and it restarts constantly after I close it and shut it down thus draining my battery a lot but in all a great app
FEATURE REQUEST
All my searches were rap genre related so there were a lot of things that couldn't be found.
FEATURE REQUEST
Trust this review This app sucks...it doesn't even have music only stupid little sound postcasts if you like that get the app of not DON'T
FEATURE REQUEST
Hayden jacobs It is a good app but it does not have some of the music that you want to listen to so I still us the app that's why I give this app a four star
FEATURE REQUEST
Frostwire alone is very cheezy but wen u add the plus to it it goes from cheezy to cherry.
FEATURE REQUEST
Torrent app amazingl has all the music I've been missing it's amazing
FEATURE REQUEST
Been using it for years and can't complain I get what I need when I need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Plus they need more songs  so if you add more songs I'll give five stars
FEATURE REQUEST
Some songs are missing like Ballad of Mona Lisa but I still love it!
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be better if The songs would actually stay permanently deleted once I delete them & I didn't have to delete them five or six times smh
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app wish they had more songs
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to be able to preview songs before downloading.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish they would add jarren benton my grand Mas basement
FEATURE REQUEST
OK Need more music
FEATURE REQUEST
@Dev Could you please add the option in the settings for enabling ""Volume key Scrolling"" .
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish this app could overcome that problem in some way.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's so easy to use that even a baby would be able to use it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some settings are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app with a big imperfection Would be perfect if ""tap or slide to wake"" was more precise and also took into account proximity sensor  so that wouldn't be activating at all times is inside your pocket.
FEATURE REQUEST
mostly great app for those who loved custom ROM this app would be great to maximize you android performance
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks the problem is now fixed In previous version my CPU was changing frequency on its own...but now o can set any static frequency all the time my fone is now completely lag free.
FEATURE REQUEST
it will set what u want  you must have a custom kernel with OVERCLOCK ability!Best kernel tweaker bar none!!
FEATURE REQUEST
No busybox included Would be better if busybox is included inside this app  so user doesn't need to install busybox again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great UI  it's like the first app that must be installed on root user  like having total control over my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Best app for whom those who knows what they are doing in the app .means there should be an option for recommended tweaks
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm missing the old great version.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was an old version of the app  some legacy version would be cool.
FEATURE REQUEST
Edit: Yes  they are fabs but if we had just one fab on the bottom right corner (which upon pressing could show these options) that would be really nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you want donations  add a donate button.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now i need to find another app like this.
FEATURE REQUEST
adding ads to this app is a bad idea mate   the app is now slower and laggier than ever specially on old devices  and sometimes it crashes because of ads loading   so please make it ad-free !
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for adding the feature of opening app from notification
FEATURE REQUEST
Everything you need to tweak your rooted device is in this simple  clean  elegant and easy to use app :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Galaxy S7 Much needed control for root with the S7.
FEATURE REQUEST
If not  there would be another kernel manager that is better than this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best kernel editor This is my goto when I need to take a peek under the hood of the device  and the support with Tasker and similar apps made this one the best.
FEATURE REQUEST
Don't see the point of adding ads to an app whose userbase is COMPLETELY ROOTED.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really know what i need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding the frequency reset is great too.
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to say anything about the rest of the app  it was always by far the best  and is even better now.
FEATURE REQUEST
Note your phone has to be rooted  and your kernel needs to support these options in order for the settings to work.
FEATURE REQUEST
If it does  you can change pretty much anything you want  like clock speeds  voltages  schedulers  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
For example on the Overall tab  the Temperature card could be reduced to like a single row while still using the circles for the numbers.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best Has everything you need an more.
FEATURE REQUEST
You missed the point of several important features going 'missing'.
FEATURE REQUEST
Am I missing something?
FEATURE REQUEST
All phone should have this application Yeah!!
FEATURE REQUEST
You need something to get the job done this is it.
FEATURE REQUEST
(was: I would like to see confirmation that all of my CPU cores are being overclocked.
FEATURE REQUEST
it would be better if I can boost my mobile sound
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice one Works gr8 please add support for enabling   etc for sweep2sleep
FEATURE REQUEST
Advanced enough Truly what we need for a rooted phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app no need to pay for features
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if it could detect your ROM and suggest new Kernels for your device.
FEATURE REQUEST
IT NEEDS TO BE DONE!
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  if you make a mistake with one of your settings  it gives you a timeframe where it will countdown before it applies the settings meaning you can go in and change it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great to know which profile is active.
FEATURE REQUEST
Useful Should cover most of the things you need to modify
FEATURE REQUEST
Just need a little asking from forum and u can use it easily.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needed You can do a lot from editing you build.ini to battery and to tweaking your cpu with just this app
FEATURE REQUEST
Best kernel manager Please add performance mode setting.
FEATURE REQUEST
I did tests and even after I leave this garbage nothing else will work and CPU utilization is at 100% from yours truly.
FEATURE REQUEST
Then I figured it might be kernal related so I found this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Accidentally changing some critical settings may cause serious errors..why there is no option to revert the settings to default values available the application?
FEATURE REQUEST
But you really need to work on a new name because ""Adiutor"" just doesn't sound right.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish kernel developers would make their kernels more compatible so I wouldn't have to switch between 2 apps!
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome But  can you please give us a guide for performance setup?
FEATURE REQUEST
And now I can play hd game with swap Ram perfectly and can use upto 350 MB swap.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add a feature to the ""profile"" pages which well automatically trigger profiles when an event occurs such as screen off etc. ?
FEATURE REQUEST
When applying profiles it would be great if you add a toast saying changes applied successfully.
FEATURE REQUEST
All you need Small  compact.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  but need more settings.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hi  can you please add these ""sched_wakeup_granularity_ns""  ""sched_latency_ns""  ""sched_min_granularity_ns"" settings to your app.
FEATURE REQUEST
HTC One m8 If only apply on boot settings could be hidden.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish it had a widget that displayed the cpu screen with the cores and other info
FEATURE REQUEST
Everything you need Everything you need fit your kernel tweaking needs
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome Add per app modes and this will be top notch :)
FEATURE REQUEST
I think it will be great if you add what happend in our phone if we change the kernel settings to know what to do.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good It only lacks a setting for the TtWake duration feature of some kernels.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it gets as comprehensive as synapse but it's amazing still as it is!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but missing some options.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add those for 5 star
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to do manually by pressing test key..need attention
FEATURE REQUEST
Extremely useful app Can u add GPU frequency setting for the asus zenfone 2 z3560 and z3580 plz in the future.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awsome Does everything I need it to and more.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very Good But  I %100 agree with Lucia Carpenter about some details & missed information  for people who are not familiar with each & every tweak.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is a bit embracing as we have to change settings every time to switch between profiles.
FEATURE REQUEST
very usefull app  hope you can add msm limiter on cpu so that frequency settings will stick on android m.
FEATURE REQUEST
Android root user I am using galaxy grand gt- i9082.I need a video about how to operate kernel and how it works any one give the link thanks in advance
FEATURE REQUEST
Better app Should add some descrition
FEATURE REQUEST
I know a lot about these types of functions but some to me are even a little confusing and so need to be googled.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish it had pre-configured profiles.
FEATURE REQUEST
the app does all you need to do in kernel!
FEATURE REQUEST
Like street signs  software descriptions need to be spelt correctly I would have more confidence in software if written by someone who can spell the description of its primary function.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  for a person who isnt very knowledgeable  it would be nice to know what the different values are and the ranges that are acceptable.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you need to tune your kernel and device  this app is one of the best!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Does what I need
FEATURE REQUEST
it resolved some issues on my sony xperia z1 c6903 lollipop 5.0..overheating.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing APP   please add support for the simple thermal driver by sultanxda
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add this feature (: would save me a lot of time because as of right now I'm googling a bunch of definitions.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think this app should come included with all ROMs.
FEATURE REQUEST
There are two things I really wish it had though: 1) an option to override system settings: 2) deeper integration.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everything you need  nothing you don't.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great  does it all but one tiny gripe as I am OCD  after I set my profile - why does it have to tell me Every single time in the notifications it applied changes on reboot  I get it to show the first time  but every time nor do I need the icon up in my top left bumping out my ram ""clock"" in favor of it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Will buy donate when refill my card attached next Wednesday  DPR2503 PS: In future update maybe will be able to keep on notifications!
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add a reset option for changing values
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm only missing swipe to sleep direction (RTL).
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add support for arter97's Lazyplug hotplug
FEATURE REQUEST
I should be able to turn off all notifications and not have a service still running when I shut the app down.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice new design  major feature bug/miss Like the new design  missing some basics.
FEATURE REQUEST
When they over haul the app (as they're promising to do) I'll try it again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Took off two stars because it seems there is no way to disable push notifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
Took off an additional star because push notifications have to be manually dismissed even if you click them to read the article.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lastly  I wish it could download broadcasts for offline listening.
FEATURE REQUEST
Happy  needs to be updated more quickly I like how quickly audio loads.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to see some consistency regarding show upload times.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its missing some really basic feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I had more time to listen!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice to use  but it's a big downgrade for the recent move to prevent refresh/ update of show rundowns as they go live-to-air (it's one thing to not put up the segment recording  but not adding info on what the segment is about is another thing altogether).
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish that the in-app settings had an option to turn off the breaking-news notifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add the ability to be able to move the App to the SDcard.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  the app allows you to save a bunch of podcasts to a Playlist  but there is no easy way to bring back up the Playlist and start listening.
FEATURE REQUEST
No audios Well need to have all features audio
FEATURE REQUEST
If you add something to your listen list  it clears by itself even when listening to it.
FEATURE REQUEST
After that  I had to uninstall because there is no way to disable push notifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's NPR Love NOT app could use update but they are working on it
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing stations My local stations went missing on the latest version!
FEATURE REQUEST
Lack of user controls.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Things No way to send private feedback.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if you could fix this  as it is annoying at best and on occasion has given me quite a fright when I heard ghostly voices coming from an empty room.
FEATURE REQUEST
Applications and services need to learn the difference between marketing themselves and being overbearing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Notifications should be optional Breaking news notifications should have the option to be turned off.
FEATURE REQUEST
And there is no way to disable it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Update ruined a good thing Stories dont always fully load and playlists clear on their own whether or not you want them to.
FEATURE REQUEST
I check the app daily  I don't need to be notified hourly of new stories.
FEATURE REQUEST
Notifications for which there is no way to opt-out is completely unacceptable.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I tried to restart my station was gone from my favorites and could no longer be located.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be fine if it picked up where it stopped but it doesnt ):
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding this complaint to obsolete content and the very annoying twenty minute cutoff for shows that are longer than twenty minutes  and I am uninstalling.
FEATURE REQUEST
My connection drop randomly (with no change in wifi or network signal strength)  it's takes way too long to connect to my local station and the UI needs an update.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love being able to stream my local station but this app needs work.
FEATURE REQUEST
The android app lacks basic features that are in the iOS app such as moving heard stories into an Already Played list.
FEATURE REQUEST
Based on from looking at your lack of response to the legitimate-sounding customer complaints.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works fine but looks very tired  app BADLY needs bringing in to 2016.
FEATURE REQUEST
I add things to my playlist  listen to some of them  come back an hour or two later and my playlist is empty.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no way to stop them through the app settings  so I'm probably going to uninstall it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pleas add this setting or stop sending notifications on random stories.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish it kept track of episodes I've already listen to.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish I could get PRO shows as well like on the NPROne app.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to make it a: 100% SD CARD APP for storage conservation!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app overall I wish they would allow comments on the news reports.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wind up missing most of the context and spend the entire story trying to figure out what it is actually about.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not going to accommodate what's comfortable with my tablet case for what could easily be fixed with a bit of effort.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to be able to continue streaming.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but could be better I think it would be a good feature to allow users to download audio ahead of time (for example  I want to download the entire morning edition program so I can listen to it later  but I don't want to stream every segment individually because it uses data).
FEATURE REQUEST
Good source of news I would like to be able to view in landscape mode on my tablet.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing a great deal of functionality.
FEATURE REQUEST
The other apps have a very limited selection of programs and even the programs that are listed are missing several episodes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Why would anybody want an app that lacks that capability?
FEATURE REQUEST
I like it fine for on the go  though I use almost exclusively for radio station streaming  which is very conspicuously missing a ""cast"" option for Chromecast Audio.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really wish there were an option to have only audio stories show.
FEATURE REQUEST
Tablet needs to rotate What a waste have to use this apt in portrait only.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have a feeling this is a lack of servers on npr's side
FEATURE REQUEST
But to be usable it should have Chromecast features.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way to hear the entire story is to manually reload it.
FEATURE REQUEST
APP NEEDS AN UPDATE!
FEATURE REQUEST
Need up to update for android marshmellow!
FEATURE REQUEST
I WISH it worked on my new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
App needs visual overhaul Love NPR  not so much this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
They allowed their editor's and journalist to erase Israel with Palestine.They claim it was due to lack of time  but how does one replace an entire country due to working under pressure?
FEATURE REQUEST
They claim out was due to lack of timing  but how does one replace an entire country due to working under pressure.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like NPR but if there were a more reliable way to stream my local station I'd dump the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
If we want privacy we need to ding apps that for no apparent reason collect our info.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's just an extra click that is not necessary.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs a better UI.
FEATURE REQUEST
Playback stops too frequently Seems like it needs smarter buffering.
FEATURE REQUEST
There must be a better NPR app but I haven't found one yet.
FEATURE REQUEST
With all due respect he should be fired for spending our contributions.
FEATURE REQUEST
App works well just wish they had Chromecast App works well.
FEATURE REQUEST
There was no way to disable the app from running in the notifications area.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also it would be nice if the app could seamlessly play the radio through a wifi to mobile data transition.
FEATURE REQUEST
Feels like these bugs should be hashed out by now.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need real time news  as it's happening now  not a year ago.
FEATURE REQUEST
Independent news - perfect We need independent news.
FEATURE REQUEST
Topics should have its own drop down menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks basic controls and seamless network switching My biggest gripes were a lack of lockscreen controls and that streaming stops when switching between WiFi and LTE.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing functions.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good info  but battery drain I want to keep the app  but can't justify why a news app needs to constantly run in the background.
FEATURE REQUEST
The App is good but I'm extraordinarily missing the 24h Program Stream which is readily available on the homepage.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be good again if this was addressed.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm going to need to find another app if this doesn't get fixed soon -- I listen to a live stream of morning edition when I wake up and walk to work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really miss them!
FEATURE REQUEST
*** 鈥斺€?gt;&gt; (If you need an EXCELLENT podcatcher for NPR programs and more  I highly recommend PODCAST ADDICT 鈥?By far  it's the most complete and best maintained podcast player around!)
FEATURE REQUEST
So far the only way I've found to prevent this is to clear my playlist before I exit.
FEATURE REQUEST
* Lack of settings/control - more options  especially around privacy would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
This issue could be related to switching between different wireless routers and 4G.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not bad  good info  but needs Landscape mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
NPR app Good content  has a very good collection of subsidiary podcasts  although the podcast player is completely out of control  and will just open at will when you add items to your playlist  unless force closed.
FEATURE REQUEST
All news articles should have audio streams.
FEATURE REQUEST
NPR needs to figure out how the music streaming services keep playback uninterrupted (better buffering?)
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be better if  like Pandora or other audio apps  when you left the audio for minute it would simply pause.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would give it all 5 stars if I could take the hourly news audio from the ""play hourly news"" option and add it to my playlist so the hourly news would play automatically after my queued stories.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also it suffers from a few annoying usability issues  most notably the fact that for some reason  if you want to load all the stories from a program like All Things Considered into your playlist  you need to scroll down to the bottom of the list  load more  scroll  load  scroll load.
FEATURE REQUEST
Podcasts Please add invisibilia to the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  there should be a way to close the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
You should add Chromecast to this app because NPR One sucks.
FEATURE REQUEST
wish the hourly news would stream previous hours
FEATURE REQUEST
If you enjoy getting news from a variety of sources  you should add this app to your sources.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish we could actually see videos  instead of just listen.
FEATURE REQUEST
The back end has issues they need to address.
FEATURE REQUEST
but they need to fix their backend solution.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it was consisteny Will stop shows and switch along the playlist every ten minutes or so.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if it could kill itself if not used after 15 mins or something if that's possible.
FEATURE REQUEST
Incredibly frustrating when live streaming  since it takes 10 seconds for me to restart it (while diving)...Great program for either catching up on missed episodes  or streaming live.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only problem is if you lose your network connection  it is VERY bad at re establishing communication and usually needs to be killed and restarted.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app One improvement would be the ability to download all the articles for off line reading.
FEATURE REQUEST
Boom Wish it didnt crash alot tho
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but missing ""This American Life""
FEATURE REQUEST
Stardate I wish I could get stardate updates as an alarm clock.
FEATURE REQUEST
NPR is great  the app needs improvement Allows me to listen to all my favorite NPR shows although the buggy UI needs improvement
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice - wish that we could use the app to listen to old NPR programs Only had about 3 buffering hiccups in about an hour of listening - it corrected itself quickly so I'm not sweating it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I do wish that we could use the app to listen to old recordings of NPR's programs.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everything you need to stay informed Works perfectly.
FEATURE REQUEST
People really need to chill out about it.
FEATURE REQUEST
App needs a donate button.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can only use it for the hourly news and podcasts.
FEATURE REQUEST
I've been listening in Chrome instead  so not a huge deal  but it would be nice to have in one place.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no way to close this app in Android?
FEATURE REQUEST
The lack of ability to use the ""finger pinch"" to enlarge the screen also cripples this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Even though nPR has become progressively conservative I still try to listen on occasion I thought this app might help me but it doesn't .
FEATURE REQUEST
The interface could do with quicker response time and organizing favorites could be made easier but it's not a dealbreaker.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just important need to know news
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe it needs a stronger radio or GPS signal.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sick of apps burrowing in and running ALL THE TIME when I only need them at specific times.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only thing missing is a sleep timer. . . and maybe Chromecast support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes I find myself browsing NPR and wishing I could continue a story on my mobile device at a later point if I am on the move.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like to stream your app in my car and it would be nice to add stories I am interested in from my computer and play them on my mobile device when I get into my car.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love listening to NPR and would love to be able to use the app but every time I open it  on both my phone and tablet  it closes down before I can even read the headlines.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it supported Chromecast.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it had cleaner aesthetics.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it supported Chromecast.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it supported Chromecast.
FEATURE REQUEST
NPR Very good content  frequent need to load more stories is minor annoyance
FEATURE REQUEST
Happy 40th-NPR Great radio with Robert Conley -host of All Things Considered Anniversary-we miss his voice and his visual conception of radio.
FEATURE REQUEST
Decent app Works well and is organized  wished it had Chromecast capabilities though.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's a nice app But I just need more room on my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing things They deleted ""Science Friday"" from their programs.
FEATURE REQUEST
And it may not be obvious that you need to click on an item when the list contains only one.
FEATURE REQUEST
Morning Edition) without adding them to the playlist.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cool app but missing features The app is good but could be better.
FEATURE REQUEST
As they started adding more features  things broke and became a little buggy.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to restart constantly to fix feed.
FEATURE REQUEST
When my phone is not trying to update it does what it is supposed to.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wasted space in UI Can you please add the ability to minimize the audio player on the bottom or set it to auto-hide.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if you followed Android Guidelines in design as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's NPR what more should be said.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love NPR  but app could be improved I don't know how I would live without NPR  but the app could be improved.
FEATURE REQUEST
It seems I should be able to drag playlist items into a new order  but the feature doesn't work  the app crashes at times  sometimes it says can't play this media  and I wish I could download the stories to listen when there is no internet.
FEATURE REQUEST
No landscape mode I get annoyed when an app tells me which way I need to hold my tablet  especially when it's case is designed to hold the tablet in landscape but the app insists on running in portrait mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really wish they would fix this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish it would work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing some features.
FEATURE REQUEST
offline listening missing wifi is not everywhere; need download and listen on the road.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love npr and wish it had a working app.
FEATURE REQUEST
After adding the clips of shows to playlist  I can't find the playlist.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  I wish there was some way to organize my playlist into folders.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome  but needs more work I really like everything that it's able to do.
FEATURE REQUEST
- It would be nice if I can start playing (default local station  hourly news  anything) from the widget without opening the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Terrible app  just barely works Would be great  layout and interface are nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
So this would be great if I got any volume at all.
FEATURE REQUEST
tried install on Google TV  it says that portrait mode isn't available for the app  can you enable it pl so it will work on google tv
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to have chromecast support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App that keeps one Informed Could do with some improvements such as playback selection and would like to see option for signing into profile.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if it worked with chromecast.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add Chromecast!
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice streaming app One thing that would be nice would be a setting to auto play the last steam on startup.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs improvement Unable to zoom in on images  charts  or graphs even after clicking on them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Currently I have to click npr.org and then refind the story because parts are missing from the app version.
FEATURE REQUEST
They have some NPR streams and any stream can be added manually.
FEATURE REQUEST
:) A suggestion: It would be nice to have access to the comments on the articles.
FEATURE REQUEST
At least 1/2 the stories listened to via a playlist start at the wrong position in the audio (the ending time of the last story- how is it I could determine this definitively and yet it hasn't been fixed in years?)
FEATURE REQUEST
I have a brand new s4 and can run much more complicated apps so it's the App not the phone having problems.
FEATURE REQUEST
Plus  it would be more good to have the script updated.
FEATURE REQUEST
Playlist probs (wait wait) Wait Wait - every time I add all to playlist  the segments open up halfway thru the bit  & I have to open it & reset to the beginning.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks display settings Any app for reading needs display choices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could use this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can add shows to my queue but whether or not it actually loads right is a gamble.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes I load things  give up  and a couple hours later it starts to play out of the blue (really nice when I'm in situations like a work meeting  and my phone starts blaring) I'm giving it 2 stars because when it works  it's so nice (I can listen to entire programs  which I like since I have a few I like to listen start to finish  like Morning Edition) but honestly NPR - with the constant reviews and complaints about how buggy this app is  you really need to get it together and fix it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be better if they just rolled it back to the older app than having people constantly battle the current one.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it allowed offline reading.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a live feed I also wish the app gave you the option to download the podcasts (totally key on long flights - I'm too cheap to pay for in flight wifi) The loading is rather slow even on quick wifi and it crashes more than the typical app
FEATURE REQUEST
When I try to play my station (WPLM-FM Nashville)  it does connect but when I hit play it says there's no audio available.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great content  needs updated design Things like no pause button on the notifications screen and the fact the hourly news is not a simple button click make this app frustrating.
FEATURE REQUEST
Decent  but needs work Specifically  the ability to switch into landscape mode for tablets.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would absolutely LOVE to be able to run an activity or send an intent to immediately begin streaming the hourly news bulletin.
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be nice if it refreshed a little more often though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for adding widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI could use a little help  too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please upgrade There needs to be a SAVE BUTTON.
FEATURE REQUEST
Due to lack of a shopkeeper  I was able to pick up everything  free of charge.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish the in app purchases actually let you buy things like.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please update it..add more content or something.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love to see if it could be addressed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Should try make a first person version of this its pretty hard there's this game that's soulda like it (delver) but good game
FEATURE REQUEST
A roguelike gem Pixel Dungeon is grindy  challenging  packs infinite replayability  aesthetic charm and decent controls - everything you need to get your roguelike fix on the go.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it could be easyer to find food and it will be great if you can craft.
FEATURE REQUEST
Mp Please add multiplayer game mode and I might add 5 stars
FEATURE REQUEST
I really hate when I reached floor 8 and died and I need to play from floor 1 again
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I wish this pixel dungeon can play coop with my friends using Bluetooth or tethering hotspot and can revive in every entrance or back to the first floor without using Anhk to revive  the requirements only is money and it cost only 100.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pleas add different difficulty levels
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game but you should try to improve the combat interface cuz when i tap on the enemies the guy just walks behind and i find the attack button too uncomfortable.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Game Addictive game but this game could have some saving progress
FEATURE REQUEST
New wepons Awsome game have been playing for a long time both me and my brothers love playing but it needs new wepons and armour.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great besides I wish there was more classes to play as
FEATURE REQUEST
Also you should only be given 1 free food per five levels to make it more challenging.
FEATURE REQUEST
A Good Challenge The best randomly generated dungeon diving game where resourcefulness  awareness  and luck are needed to survive.
FEATURE REQUEST
You'll see some negative reviews complaining about item durability: they miss the point.
FEATURE REQUEST
We need something new.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not that the mechanics itself is bad  but the way it's currently implemented  is extremely unbalanced.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add magic guns and ammo Add new features
FEATURE REQUEST
If anybody is finding it a bit difficult I suggest getting the unleashed version.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really good It's that kind of game that you play as something to kill time with  while it's a really good game and shouldn't be honored as a side game
FEATURE REQUEST
Good game There are many mods for this game that must be tried
FEATURE REQUEST
Hard this game is too hard I can't reach lvl 6  pls add Multiplayer (party) mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very stupid good Smells like poop I need to take a break
FEATURE REQUEST
My mates would always like to contest whom will live the longest  however I believe this game will be more fun surviving with others.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add multiplayer!
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add more levels!
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it You should add Shacks to the game.
FEATURE REQUEST
The game is too hard  to the point that you are playing over and over just to get that one lucky run.
FEATURE REQUEST
No ads Everybody stop complaining  learn what a rogue-like is and learn to play the game  the mechanics are complex but you need to learn them
FEATURE REQUEST
Having a soft save ability at interval bosses would be nice also
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be an easy mode or some health perk you can enable for that.
FEATURE REQUEST
After beating it 4(5) times I can say that random traps need to be removed  as a rng chance you take heavy damage by walking is just retarded.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also more variety and difference between the different rooms and enemy's would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love the game  its simple  cool  and it kills time anywhere  I just wish it was available on windows phones (my phone is wp8.1 and tablet is android)
FEATURE REQUEST
No point I think the game should at least be beatable.
FEATURE REQUEST
The degradation feature really sucks though  I wish it was optional.
FEATURE REQUEST
one of the best rouge like games ever keep adding contents please :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Pixel Dungeon 2 I love this game but I'm getting bored of it please make a Pixel Dungeon 2 and you should add more characters and a difficulty setting
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could put half a star.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is a GREAT game  but I feel like more should be done with it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Yes  you can heal with food  but WHAT SELF-RESPECTING PLAYER WOULD USE THEIR FOOD RATIONS TO HEAL?!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Game There maybe some things that need to be change but still a great game.Very challenging
FEATURE REQUEST
high difficulty add more chests   weapons   and food
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls add multiplayer Hi can you add multiplayer pls
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add more characters
FEATURE REQUEST
It's really good You should add pvp and coop features for online help also maybe a trading interface
FEATURE REQUEST
Great But Has Problems The hunger needs serious nerfing when you wear heavy armour.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no way to stay alive and no real tutorial to tell you what the heck you are supposed to do
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs a save or checkpoint system really badly.
FEATURE REQUEST
The lack of save is a surprising twist  that makes you even more determined to win!
FEATURE REQUEST
However I think that the bosses (mainly the goo) should be more balanced.
FEATURE REQUEST
Second there should be checkpoints if you die then instead of going back to the top you can head right to level 5 or something.
FEATURE REQUEST
A Good Game  But Too Hard I liked the game at first  but I wish there were some difficulty controls.
FEATURE REQUEST
This game i cool and all but it needs more updates.
FEATURE REQUEST
One solid made game I think that there should be more games like this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add Potion pouches or something
FEATURE REQUEST
Still trying to finish the game with rogue and huntress  hope bug fixes like missing key would be fixed soon also with the revive ankh  item should be retrieve-able
FEATURE REQUEST
I agree with others that the item degradation may not have been well thought out as well as the fact that keys must some times be randomly generated in the room they are supposed to unlock which is frustrating.
FEATURE REQUEST
the mobs need to step on it(or you) to trigger.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lots of potential could use a little bit more Could use a more clear way of getting through to the player feels like there is somthing missing
FEATURE REQUEST
i need to retry why theres nothing ""Retry"" button please reply or a respawn button please
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game but needs tweaking This is a really good game but needs some adjustments.
FEATURE REQUEST
I find that I run out of food really fast so I think you should add more food in levels or decrease hunger.
FEATURE REQUEST
All right This game is fun but somtimes too punishing they need to be able to identity everything from the start  but other than that pretty fun.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is so funny but when you die on the 5th floor with the best stuff you can get because bamn rat kills you.
FEATURE REQUEST
Suggestions I love the game but I think there is a lot missing to like I think there should be a shop in the menu and micro purchases and add a different currency but not that hard to get
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add one!
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish we could pick a difficulty
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing that I didn't like was the lack of difference between the characters; they don't feel very different to me.
FEATURE REQUEST
GREAT GAME Please add a multiplayer if possible
FEATURE REQUEST
2-just think what it should be like if there was a multiplayer mode
FEATURE REQUEST
Game idea is really good  but need lots of work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Unexpected dungeon review Just unappealing and uninteresting  I need a game that keeps me focused and entertained
FEATURE REQUEST
#1 add 1 more classes to each char pls like warrior:brawler(attacks effectively barehanded or with a knuckleduster) & rogue:thief (which can steal stuff from enemies randomly) mage:summoner(summons some sort of creature at the expense of hunger) huntress:amazon (can use spears as throwing weapon) well hope u read mu suggeation I still have more if you want
FEATURE REQUEST
Ive got an idea the IDEA add multiplayer mode i really wanna play with my friends pls reply if you will make or not make multiplayer .
FEATURE REQUEST
You should be able to save your progress.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game Wish he would update more constantly.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if we could get permanent upgrades after many playthroughs like Desktop Dungeons.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add an easy mode (which will probably still be more difficult than 99% of RPGs out there).
FEATURE REQUEST
Health loss is common and unavoidable  scarce healing resources  hunger/ starvation comes on too quickly  scarce food resources  potions and scrolls are a crap-shoot so there is no way to strategize their use  and also permadeath.
FEATURE REQUEST
ADD MORE I think this game should add more like more classes or maybe multiplayer lel but please just add more fun it will be interesting if there are more classes :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Decent It's a good game altogether  but I deleted it because of the lack of a save feature  which is a crucial thing to RPGs.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd like to eventually be like ""Oh  cool  'MANNAZ'  I needed to enchant this scale armor.""
FEATURE REQUEST
Only wish that we could save and load instead of having to start over after every death!
FEATURE REQUEST
Knowing how much HP I have would be helpful if it could be listed in the bar instead of just a graphical representation.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also if the option to have a second quickslot could be permanently changed when I select it that would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I needed Something easy to pick up but challenging to master.
FEATURE REQUEST
A nice feature to add would be a trinket slot and have like 20 different trinkets that we could use.
FEATURE REQUEST
Many people liked TBOIs different gameplay scheme and that would be nice here as well
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game only wish there was multiplayer
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there's a ""continue or save button"".
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add multiplayer plz
FEATURE REQUEST
My favorite mobile game but my god it needs some fixing!
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't hate the idea but I think it should at least be an option to the player if they want to play with it as a factor ot not.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love the game Love this game  but really need a code for food.
FEATURE REQUEST
I Love it I wish you can add some companions in this game ^_^
FEATURE REQUEST
I love the game despite my lack of experience with roguelikes.
FEATURE REQUEST
ok game needs more stuff
FEATURE REQUEST
I have a few thing that may make the game better first please add joystick like you can change beetween joystick and click to move second pls pls pls add multiplayer i want to play with my friend thanks
FEATURE REQUEST
You should add more main classes but otherwise amazing game
FEATURE REQUEST
Too hard This game would be so much better if they gave you instructions on how not to die within a few minutes or give you a save option.
FEATURE REQUEST
The fact that there is no death penalty (but needing to restart the level) there's no reason to get mad at the game.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its ok not my style ..i cant stand tap to move games i wish it had arrows so i could move freely but yea
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make a DLC or something for like  a new chapter for Pixel Dungeon?
FEATURE REQUEST
You should be able to have your progress saved on other devices or atleast have your achaivements transfered so you can have the huntress unlocked on all hour devices
FEATURE REQUEST
great game wish you release the second sequel haha
FEATURE REQUEST
You should add bows.
FEATURE REQUEST
Should have the ability to flip the screen like other apps do.
FEATURE REQUEST
Game needs: This is a great game that me and my friends play and talk about together all the time but it would be a lot better with a multiplayer mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
This game will make you rage quit so bad you'll play it again afterwards.
FEATURE REQUEST
;D This game  everything about it is perfect  I just need to know 100 per cent how the game functions 3;
FEATURE REQUEST
Huntress needs a buff Overall a good game but the huntress needs some sort of buff to make her stronger.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game but I wish I could save my progress.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome but This is awesome but it needs a save button
FEATURE REQUEST
Also I would not kill you even if u add some adds.
FEATURE REQUEST
GAME NEEDS WORK.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice This is a good game  but it would be nice with a tutorial.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it were a bit more complex  like Nethack or even ToME or Cataclysm  but nobody seems to have successfully adapted those to an ergonomic mobile interface  so Pixel Dungeon is always my number one choice if I've got some time to kill (and even if I don't  haha).
FEATURE REQUEST
But I just wish that there was a D-pad or something instead of touch.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please Add D-PAD setting.
FEATURE REQUEST
I Love Everything About This Game This is how a mobile game should be done.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  i dont know what kind of rng may have been changed.
FEATURE REQUEST
The developer is always fixing it and adding new content  great job!!
FEATURE REQUEST
I was a little skeptic at first but then I got into it and let's just say I have a lot of other things I need to catch up on...thanks a lot Dave  I think I am going to do stuff now...or after I beat the game with the mage since it's my last class to do so...then I will stop...or after the sub classes...or after the challenges...humm.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fun I think you should get it
FEATURE REQUEST
Good overall I think it needs a saving feature  or a separate endless mode  I'd like to get to the end someday
FEATURE REQUEST
I love everything about this game and I wish I could give you more than 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's okay Just wish I could save so every time i died i didn't have to start all over
FEATURE REQUEST
Challenging Amazing and very hard rpg type game just wish it had more of a store type upgrade aspect
FEATURE REQUEST
WAY TOO HARD The game is fun but way too difficult.
FEATURE REQUEST
The sheer hard work needed to get there makes it anything but unsatisfying
FEATURE REQUEST
Appstore needs more games like this!
FEATURE REQUEST
Can't save I liked the game  but it will be much better if it can saved ;-)
FEATURE REQUEST
I love the game But maybe you could possibly add a multiplayer so you can kill stuff in a team
FEATURE REQUEST
GG I Like It ;3 But They Need To Change Some Glitchs
FEATURE REQUEST
Better if you could have added multiplayer as i want to play with my friends
FEATURE REQUEST
Just hope that in next update you can make it so you can the items you pick up in dungeon and allow us to customize our characters as well as add different types to play as.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it was more easier but the game is fun tho and hard at the same time
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make respawn!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish that you didn't have to restart every time you die when you make it so far though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really great probably one of the best RPG games out there but sincerely needs a save mechanic that would make this game so much better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Add more classes.plz
FEATURE REQUEST
Good It's cool but needs something
FEATURE REQUEST
Can't Save Progress I wish I could save so I didn't have to start from the very beginning with nothing!
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately there are several classic blunders that just make it missed the mark.
FEATURE REQUEST
Food is required  yet food is not plentiful within the dungeon.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great  only one complaint What you could have more than one game
FEATURE REQUEST
Only way to refresh health is through upgrade scrolls and/or Enchantment Scrolls which don't spawn randomly enough.
FEATURE REQUEST
Y U NO RESPAWN Wish there were checkpoints for levels :( but otherwise good game just give us some checkpoints
FEATURE REQUEST
Even if the dungeon is endless  there would be no way to find out if everything kills you by level 3.
FEATURE REQUEST
Patience  stubbornness and adaptivity are needed to get to the later levels or beating to game.
FEATURE REQUEST
I reached level 24 and I wasn't watching my health and I had everything you need to win and I lost everything but I had 3 ankh and I lost 2 when I died so eventually all the traps got me!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Not bad 5 if you add more levels lmao great game tho
FEATURE REQUEST
I would need to clear the data to play it again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missed two badges.
FEATURE REQUEST
You should add a toggle for item degradation in the options.
FEATURE REQUEST
Too RNG I enjoy many things about this game but unless you get really lucky you're not going to go far.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think you should add a hero - beastmaster.
FEATURE REQUEST
I liked it  but its still needs a controls pad.
FEATURE REQUEST
If i can change the controls its would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
The well of change needs to work and mabey a new character like an archer and bows should be added with different types of arrows.
FEATURE REQUEST
Title Could we eat rats?I mean it's a weird concept but could we be able to have the rats drop like mystery meat?
FEATURE REQUEST
Literally the best No special privilages needed  not a lot of space taken up for downloading  and so much fun to play.
FEATURE REQUEST
Multiplayer This needs a local multiplayer setting
FEATURE REQUEST
Would like to see a shop within the game to buy and sell equipment and stuff
FEATURE REQUEST
I love the game  but i hate the huntress and the lack of saves.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also please add bigger levels  more food  4 ring slots instead of 2.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love the game I love the game but i wish i could save.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good game I do enjoy the challenge but I would love a difficulty setting option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now  I practically have to *try* to lose the game in order to die.
FEATURE REQUEST
If anything  it needs more floors and harder enemies.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing This game is never the same when you play it and anything can happen  there is a lot of depth and time put into this game and I appreciate that its free along with that.I wish I was a little better but its still a great game
FEATURE REQUEST
Addictive If only there would be a name mechanic my characters would be sir-die-a-lot  still love the rng in gsne  though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Text scrolling Some way to scroll through your text notifications would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
No clue You can't even find a chest and add a bow
FEATURE REQUEST
Please  add more random events and quests.
FEATURE REQUEST
Loved it Only thing is that you should be able to save the games.
FEATURE REQUEST
Between wandering aimlessly and starving to death  and dying for the millionth time to a small group of rats  I realized that my time could be better spent picking the skin in the corner of my fingernails.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was more food tho.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game Needs more characters  and maybe something else to make the game a tad bit easier.
FEATURE REQUEST
Yes Ooooh yeah very nice but add something new
FEATURE REQUEST
If You Could Add In Something Like A Option For That It'd Be Great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing So good but there should be a better moving system
FEATURE REQUEST
The degradion mechanic adds no fun but insted ruins the game.There are barely enough scrolls of upgrade/enchant at first and now its rare.There are not enough food once get to dwarfen city/hunger degrade too fast.There is a huge diffculty gap between dwarfen city and Demon hall.But it's overall a great game.rewarding players that are pation .players costantly need to plan there new move carefully which I like.
FEATURE REQUEST
P.S add more story.
FEATURE REQUEST
we need food like every 20 steps.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if there's a Save Option so that your Progress would be safe .
FEATURE REQUEST
Please Add it
FEATURE REQUEST
First few areas are easy  but the dwarves and demon halls need to be toned down
FEATURE REQUEST
When you die I think ou should have 5 Mins to find your lost gear on the same level not having the game load a new level.
FEATURE REQUEST
Having problems Can't download the game bet it's a great game wish I could play
FEATURE REQUEST
So sad It would be great if you guys add saving point after every boss battle.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish that there was a spell for repairing our stuff.
FEATURE REQUEST
It keeps adding new stuff too.
FEATURE REQUEST
It should be able to be toggled or a hardmode or something.
FEATURE REQUEST
NO SAVE THERE NEEDS TO BE A SAVE
FEATURE REQUEST
Great game I just wish that the mods could interact with one another.
FEATURE REQUEST
Have u thought of a number 2 Hey I love this game but after you finish it it sorta looses its charm what about a number 2 with a name and theme like Pixel Dungeon 2 City Chronicles or some thing it would just be cool to continue the fun please respond back or make the game.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have an idea You don't have to do this  but do you think you could add multiplayer to the game to make the experience of the game better?
FEATURE REQUEST
We need multiplayer We need multiplayer
FEATURE REQUEST
Some levels have lock rooms but the keys are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ideas for additions: Add a 'throb entire screen red when hp is low (and maybe players can set the percent)'  space the buttons so the game can be played on devices with small screens without searching when trying to rest for one enemy's step  fix auto-pathing (it currently paths based on enemies that are not visible and steps back and forth when no path is available)  bugfix the autopathing arrow after a fight (frequently only advances one step or disappears without other actions)  fix the wand of reach (does not switch with enemies as the description states) and a few other things.
FEATURE REQUEST
pita to have to keep changing it; I've *never* played a game past lvl 6 or so where I didn't use both slots (or wished there were 2 before you added that).
FEATURE REQUEST
Update: this is fixed by adding both a mask size and peer address on the dialog box for address.
FEATURE REQUEST
Force all traffic through VPN The official open VPN lacks the ability to force all traffic through the VPN.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice that instead of stopping working  it tries to reconnect again automatically  so it is not necessary to always check for that and reconnect manually.
FEATURE REQUEST
Disable on wifi Would be nice to exclude wifis.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could do same thing in Android.
FEATURE REQUEST
WISH I COULD GIVE 10 STARS!
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks an important feature It is not possible to move this application to external storage (a SD card).
FEATURE REQUEST
(WARNING)g00gle RUN APP/THEY MONITOR YOUR ISP/TRAFFIC/AND MORE My VPN Service Warned me about this app Its just a gathering of your personal information they can see everything you do and monitor your online where abouts.A REAL VPN will NEVER be FREE and the VPN must be located off shore.Wont log any info at all from its user.This app ask if you agree to let g00gle and the app monitor and see where you go online or you can't use it.This is a dangerouse app.The only way to be %100 hidden online is a VPN and then run it through Tor.Dont install!
FEATURE REQUEST
For example I need to be connected to my work network while not in office via VPN  but when I enter to the office VPN connection should be stopped allowing direct communication.
FEATURE REQUEST
Complained there was either missing  or unneeded arguments in one of its generated cache files.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I will be able to use public Wi-Fi with no worries as the start up is just a click.
FEATURE REQUEST
Clunky since the last UI update I would still like an option to disable the confirmation dialog  if it is to be kept in at all  it does scarcely more than waste my time  providing ""feedback"" where there is no need for it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you also add native support for VPN over SSL or VPN over SSH?
FEATURE REQUEST
How can I make the profile in this app please tell me
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be better with horizontal paddings on the log screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
NAT Works perfectly But can u add NAT mode for rooted users?
FEATURE REQUEST
There is also a ""static-challenge"" line in the config file that could be used to prompt for a 2FA code before attempting to connect.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing wrong with this app is the lack of a Donate button to reward the author.
FEATURE REQUEST
All the tones are very high More variety would be nice
FEATURE REQUEST
If u add the integration option or atleast guide people to use it  you'll have an even better rating :).
FEATURE REQUEST
Great job Would love to see a material design
FEATURE REQUEST
Delivers what you need It gives results very fast for me it's worked out really well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Interface could use some work though  if you ever get the time :p
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if the sound didn't cut out.
FEATURE REQUEST
I loved it Extremely helpful to study n relax.but I have one query can I use the ADHD preset while I m studying or working?does ADHD need a specific environment.plz reply
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding full internet ""permissions"" in probable attempt to monetize app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Tones work in waking modes but any that you want to use to relax meditating  sleeping  are way way to high pitched  lower pitched freqs in the sub 73 hz are needed to make this really work for the three needs listed above.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed this app again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app needs more selection
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add something related to weight loss
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty good Its ok but you should add an endorphin release preset  so far best app of this kind.
FEATURE REQUEST
This would never be the case if I wouldn't have used this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Studying I need an expert to tell me  is it okay to study outloud while listening to binaural beats  because i can only study and memorise when i read outloud  Thanks.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it I thought it was fake  until last night i was trying to sleep when listening this and get faster to sleep and get really good sleep
FEATURE REQUEST
HGH Hi  please add new beat for HGH boost :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Love this app I love this app just wish it had Chromecast support and sounds of nature or the ability to pice the sound that plays over the signals.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App Great App  but I wish there was an app that would allow you to record your own affirmations and the sounds.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best Love it  please add subliminal massages for money and wealth affirmation.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Everyone should have this app
FEATURE REQUEST
Noticing things like this are why I need these aids.
FEATURE REQUEST
I suggest relax melodies app which I have 4 stars so far.
FEATURE REQUEST
I suggest that you add more explanation for example : lucid dreaming  definition  how to etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be better if we can hear the voice too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works fine but needs improvements I think I could help with GUI and some improvements.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I'd found this first!
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add a quit or end option.
FEATURE REQUEST
鉂?You guys should add the option to edit and add custom beats.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome Needs more presets though
FEATURE REQUEST
It is not too big of a problem though  just one part I see that could be improved.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to use it more to see if it really helps.
FEATURE REQUEST
Study and learn Nice but there should be more effective therapies for learn and study.
FEATURE REQUEST
Caution required App needs a caution label.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's ok Would like more options but it serves as a good beginer tool
FEATURE REQUEST
The best Just need an option to change duration of therapy.
FEATURE REQUEST
It could use a few more presets but I'm not complaining!
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to see more added to it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Uninstalling due to lack of mobility in sounds.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think that would be much better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Well  I'd be happy to  if I thought that donating would make that notification (and the other little love notes) go away.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add weight loss asap.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very Helpful I would love you if you add more modes into it  e.g. Headache treatment  focusing aids...etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Revamp A new ui would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be very interesting if there was a way to make your own preset for your own use only.
FEATURE REQUEST
Kindly add om sound with 7.8 hrtz.
FEATURE REQUEST
I hope that part isn't necessary for the program to work optimally.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works like charm You need some patience with binaural beats and then you feel the magic.
FEATURE REQUEST
Minor additions would be good Ability to alter duration of programs would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I mean I use it nightly and get that the way it looks isn't a big deal but that often decides whether or not I use an app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need headphone You guys need to make it where I can use my headphones through this
FEATURE REQUEST
My daughter needs this app  but is not in the position to purchase a new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be cool if you had a few more selections but overall no issues :-)
FEATURE REQUEST
I only wish that the audio would stop when my headphones unplug; I've gotten plenty of weird looks when the audio starts coming out of my speakers.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs a [X] Close 馃敋馃摯button that ends all its processes  including background.
FEATURE REQUEST
It could have been made more clean looking.
FEATURE REQUEST
thank you very much for clearing the doubt Giorgio Regni and i would recomend Giorgio Regni that instead of playing some unpleasant noise as backgound   you could play some light music.
FEATURE REQUEST
Background sound is little scary for me so I avoid it on sleeps.Also please allow us to change duration of preset in case we need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
this app must be included on every phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Brilliant Listened to the sleep induction last night and it sent me straight off very happy  however the app could be improved if after some days of listening it picked up what you listened to the most and made recommendations or you could favourite certain beats.
FEATURE REQUEST
should have a warning in-app definitely dont use this if you have adhd or really any neurological disorders of any kind  because that puts you at a higher risk of seizures and its really not safe.
FEATURE REQUEST
the warning/disclaimer should probably be displayed upon opening the app  as its not very common for people to go through and read the details.
FEATURE REQUEST
ADHD I love love love the ADHD file  I really need it back
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to be able to change the ambience but that's still fine.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wonderful app I'm suffering from insomnia and also lack of concentration  but these app make me feel better and it's really too good.
FEATURE REQUEST
Helps me fall asleep and the lucid dreaming works great idk about the lsd drug beat it doesnt seem to work for me do you have to use it multiple times?
FEATURE REQUEST
At first I didn't know if it really worked cuz I would only use power nap but lust night I used lucid dreams and for the first time it actually worked!!
FEATURE REQUEST
U need to be patient to see it work  i got my results in a week and now i use it every night.
FEATURE REQUEST
quick feed back would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
The lower end of things is relaxing  I wish there was more of it which is the only reason I rate it 4stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs to be updated.
FEATURE REQUEST
I use this application daily when I need to concentrate.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a Windows Phone compatible version!
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there any way to set a timer so that the lucid dream beats would come on after I'm already asleep?
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't use everything usually just the shamanistic trance but it gets me into a deep sleep when I need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good one Just wish that it could be controlled in the notifications bar or there was a widget for it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if we could have the ability to add beats to it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is lacking customization option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love the idea I wish it had more instruction or reference material to know what changes to look for but I like it
FEATURE REQUEST
Changes after update Why does it stop when I try to play tje LSD drug?
FEATURE REQUEST
amazingg whatever your binural need may be  download.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very nice app  please add an option for burst mode to be a long press on the take picture button.
FEATURE REQUEST
One quick question is how can I make my default storage location be the external SD Card?
FEATURE REQUEST
Only missing panoramic view
FEATURE REQUEST
Can't use Says Street overlay is detected and must be disabled  but I have no idea which overlay is causing the issue.
FEATURE REQUEST
Autofocus could also use some improvement (more autofocus modes).
FEATURE REQUEST
Am I missing something  or is this not an option?
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App It would be more cool if there was Panorama feature
FEATURE REQUEST
This couldn't have been intended.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sexy sexy lips I hate this It freezes to munch I need something that reminds me of my old one that doesn't freezes I need something now
FEATURE REQUEST
Interested I wish it should be haired as standard default aap by some leading mobile manufacture in near future.
FEATURE REQUEST
It鈥檚 not fair to the Developer and could cause a User who really needs it  to pass it over.
FEATURE REQUEST
What you have done here should light the way for other Devs to show how this should be done.
FEATURE REQUEST
just one thing to add Please add shutter speed for this app...thats it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish that it had a camera key setting to make this selfie stick ready for my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed a video app which allowed an external mic  and this delivered.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love it every time I need to take a picture or download a camera app for new phone or tablet I come looking for this one!
FEATURE REQUEST
1) The video/photo switch button could be repositioned to the top right corner 2) top right hand to have option a ""quick key"" button choice (i.e. switch camera  last photo/video) 3) option to show or hide last video/photo.
FEATURE REQUEST
option for disabling sound required option for disabling shutter sound is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can the developer do better!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to switch front and rear camera while recording Need to switch front and rear camera while recording
FEATURE REQUEST
To do that  I needed an app that gave me total control over my smartphone camera.
FEATURE REQUEST
This has become my main camera app it has everything you need to take great photos.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only suggestion I would have is - make it possible to have different save directories for photos vs videos.
FEATURE REQUEST
They must be imported then manually moved.
FEATURE REQUEST
Better camera apps out their It is missing the ability to say smile to take a photo.
FEATURE REQUEST
It could use a shutter speed control though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you please add a panorama mode?
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect Excellent controls except needs more accessible menus and options to add on screen controls to toggle saving raw/jpg and autolevel toggle.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Can you add pause/resume bottom while video recording.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good effort  but needs improvement.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add a option to take pictures as we record
FEATURE REQUEST
The best of all Android camera apps This app enables everything you need to control your camera and works perfectly.
FEATURE REQUEST
Zoom When you zoom into the picture that you want to take it looks a bit blury so you must make it better thank you please read and jow do you turn on the flash you should have basiclly started wih a tourital first and then the people will know or now how to use this app but still very good I liked but you need to make a better one but like the with more stiff and stuff in the siffrent places please read and like I am a little kid
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but lacking Front camera mode is only square!?
FEATURE REQUEST
Good job Please add option to save mirror images (flipped photos)
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I knew about this before purchasing a different camera app Excellent app that makes the Nexus 6p camera and video usable.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's intuitive and gives me what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be cool if it was possible to make custom profiles.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also going higher than 2s exposure would be good but it might be hardware limit.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just one more feature Please add stabilization in video.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its great app but i need option of choosing micro sd as storage location.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think this app must be the default camera app of any phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
What it's missing: Ability to precisely change kelvin tempurature / Manual focus / Shutter speed / More specific iso / the ability to change almost anything on the shooting screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add face beauty mode Best camera i ever use
FEATURE REQUEST
Great camera app It's a great application for taking photos but I wish it would fill in the date original field in the EXIF data.
FEATURE REQUEST
And thank you for adding raw support.
FEATURE REQUEST
When starting the app after using it a few times  I get a fixed zoom  that is about 2 or 3 clicks zoomed in  meaning  it starts the app zoomed in a little bit and there is no way to get it to go back unless I reboot entire phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Says fps 120 but its only 28fps Im using a nexus 6p to shoot slow motion  the google camera app doesnt have manual exposure  so i need a app that can let me control exposure other wise the dam thing video keeps flickering.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see a way to export settings to a file.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lack of option Please give an option of saving of photographs in memory card.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could use a few more tweaks such as more use of Google's CC0 assets for the Globe icon and other stuff  but besides that it works great
FEATURE REQUEST
Brilliant Easy to use  all the features that I need  and more.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wonderful.thanks a lot Very nice impressive.has what I needed.better than the stock camera app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Better Need to improve.
FEATURE REQUEST
Having images take half the space compared to a regular JPG would be pretty cool especially since so many Android photo viewers support it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Probably the best but it's painfully SLOW and missing an important option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Storage needs sorting out Good app but I can't fully recommend it because it does not store image files on external SD card.
FEATURE REQUEST
Icon missing I really like how this help me make better pictures than stock app in android  for some reason though its icon has gone missing in both my phones i installed it at?
FEATURE REQUEST
Weird..if i'd be able to use icon for my launcher i'd give 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
Edit: Re-installed it on my other phone where icon is missing and found it finally lol Edit2: Icon/shortcut went nuts again
FEATURE REQUEST
However instead of a button to switch from camera to video a separate start video recording button would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent camera App I just wish that my mobile supported the extra features that are available such as manual mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
Before my pictures always needed to be cropped.
FEATURE REQUEST
I never need to crop anymore.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app One issue l have is the path to save is not use by default like other camera apps.Nice that you can change it but for some might cause issues because you have to change it to view pics from the app
FEATURE REQUEST
Only wish the UI would be better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Great app should also add slow motion mode and time lapse.
FEATURE REQUEST
But there needs to be a way to send the videos to the SD card or record directly to the SD card
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be good to have some alternatives to the default positioning of the stamp in the bottom right of the image.
FEATURE REQUEST
Again  from a field work perspective  it would be good to be able to record a brief linked voice annotation/note with each picture because that would provide an efficient way of adding additional context information to the picture.
FEATURE REQUEST
That would be much better than a simple text annotation which would quickly become a pain if taking multiple pictures on a field trip.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding voice annotation  however  would require the willingness of the developer to extend the app a bit more in the location awareness arena  e.g. storing location waypoints and linked media (photo  audio  text) in  say  GPX format for use in other apps.
FEATURE REQUEST
Might as well just use the timer  since there's no useful delay and I'd have to break pose regardless.
FEATURE REQUEST
But the user interface is pretty bad and its missing an option for slow motion video.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does not play well with Galaxy S7 It would not use my flash to take photos at all.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its good I really loved this app.But I think more features can be added .
FEATURE REQUEST
Selfi flash I hope that you add a flash to selfi shoots
FEATURE REQUEST
Only wish I could enable it to save to different folders on SD card more easily (by showing folders available rather than making you type in the path)
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what i need!
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if there was a hack to provide photosphere (this is Google fault  not the developers fault!
FEATURE REQUEST
There need to be three separate calibrations  one for portrate  and one for each of rotate 90 degrees left and right.
FEATURE REQUEST
Every other developers need to learn from ur app.U just did something in 1.3mb..its awsm.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I needed I didn't want a editor or stuff like that I just wanted a camera because my stupid camera on my tablet is front facing all The time!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Beautify mode should be added.
FEATURE REQUEST
developer please add night vision too in the options...keep improving...donation is important for hard work
FEATURE REQUEST
Can an option be added to turn off the screem while recording video to conserve battery during long shots?
FEATURE REQUEST
its too good can you please add a focus slider like asus  zenphone camera manual mode have?
FEATURE REQUEST
This would need to do everytime I open the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really needs pause button This app is really good but it really needs a pause button for the video section.
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately  most either focus too slow  hang when viewing photos  miss the mark on color or clarity  or don't have enough features for an avid photographer.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but only one thing is missing what is really annoying for me.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like it but it'd be cool to see a change in the interface.
FEATURE REQUEST
Problem on Z5 premium Needs fixing for Sony Xperia Z5 premium.
FEATURE REQUEST
It seems to be a nice App  when it works  but the developer needs to fix this issue .
FEATURE REQUEST
Exactly what I needed Control everything perfectly with no ads.
FEATURE REQUEST
File not saved Pics couldn't be saved even on lot of space
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish you would incorporate RAW support too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only suggestion I can make is   if there is way you can add the feature where both front and back cameras can work at the same time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Makes good pictures  GUI could be better Having to go to menus to change scene type or other details is a bit annoying.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you reduce mic volume Hi I use a lavilier mic with my phone to record better audio but the problem I am having is that the audio is peaking and clipping I need to somehow reduce the mic input gain can this app do that?
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was panorama feature as my phone(moto g3) lacks it
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to have a minimal interface with smooth Material Design animations.
FEATURE REQUEST
Enough so  that I keep missing pictures and I'm not willing to make it my default just yet
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for volume button control Needed autofucus on anywhere on screen out struck at one place
FEATURE REQUEST
Fine Needs more (fun).
FEATURE REQUEST
Need solve bug Apps still buggy
FEATURE REQUEST
Need some ui improvement Need some ui improvement
FEATURE REQUEST
When I'll be able to donate - I'll do it!
FEATURE REQUEST
It will be more useful if the developers give the option to use head set as a cable release.
FEATURE REQUEST
it is the only feature I can think of that is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
If dev gets time to reply me I would be glad to point out what I m missing
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Love this app..only wish i could save it to a folder in my gallery
FEATURE REQUEST
[Edit] Needs a grid overlay for composition  Quick to boot  but laggy in between taking shots  pics can often be noisy with artifacts.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm sure this will get fixed in the near future  but for now it's a no-go.
FEATURE REQUEST
UI needs a makeover with bigger  more finger- friendly buttons.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice one It would be nice a touch in it's interface.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need forward/backward angle also!
FEATURE REQUEST
The GUI design needs some serious work  the style it's outdated  like android 2.3 outdated.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best but needs improvement You need to improve the presentation and background of the camera
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect I would just like to see a shutter speed control and it would be the perfect manual control camera apps out there to my opinion
FEATURE REQUEST
Way better than Google s default camera on my Nexus 6.
FEATURE REQUEST
When taking a video  the video needs to be paused and resumed.
FEATURE REQUEST
The performance of the app needs to be faster
FEATURE REQUEST
Help When I take a photo of some sheets of paper I need to send  it re-orients to a different angle.
FEATURE REQUEST
Unlimited burst is basically a time lapse that you could advertise but having to keep the screen on for long times outside is getting the phone too hot.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if there was a option to add ""Author"" details to the exif header - for copywrite purposes.
FEATURE REQUEST
it need photo mode or user customised photo mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but needs more work This app is free and is great.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it needs more tinkering especially with the marshmallow update.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm currently using Sony Xperia Z3 with marshmallow 6.0.1 again the app is good but needs more tinkering.
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe i messed up the settings  although i experimented and tested different ways but i have no luck with videos  which is what i need it for.
FEATURE REQUEST
This has all the functions I've been missing since I moved from HTC phones.
FEATURE REQUEST
please add an additional sponsored app
FEATURE REQUEST
But missing 4k for Galaxy S6 Galaxy s6 is limited to 1080p recording regardless if experimebtal UHD 4k is enabled.
FEATURE REQUEST
A response would be nice  thank you.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could uninstall the default camera app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be even better if we could take multiple exposure HDR photos on burst mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI design could be improved.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app that works for the most part Works well but some bugs in lg g3 need to be ironed out
FEATURE REQUEST
Especially when u need to take an urgent photo and it takes that long to open.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the video too had a running time stamp
FEATURE REQUEST
UI could be better The app is good overall.
FEATURE REQUEST
Freezes so badly that it absorbs most of the system resources and needs to be force closed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great features but lack one of the most important ones  Shutter speed!
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I had downloaded it before!
FEATURE REQUEST
And it resolved the slow focus issue on the Note 4.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would also be nice to have a histogram and focus peaking - even if they're only updated every half a second or so.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only reason i give it four stars is it lacks the panorama feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like this camera and Google supporting everything I need to open
FEATURE REQUEST
Cool app Need long press focus lock option
FEATURE REQUEST
Great UI and control I find the UI and controls best of the camera apps  however I'm missing the panorama function.
FEATURE REQUEST
Crashes After the latest update  the app keep crashes n the pictures I took are all missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
A better app compared to some default cam apps I would love it if it will work more fast
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish there was an option to expand the size of the on-screen buttons since I run pretty high resolution so they tend to be a tad tiny.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing would be an HDR feature that takes pics at different exposures and combines them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also the sound on snap needs to be able to be silent.
FEATURE REQUEST
video 10 seconds limit perfect video recording app   would be better if option to limit video to 10 seconds is added which would be useful for sending high quality videos on snapchat
FEATURE REQUEST
Please do add this features in the future
FEATURE REQUEST
Ron Works good altho would be nice if it saved settings like video focus lock.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very slow shutter Really like this app  biggest issue is that it sometimes takes an age for the shutter take the picture ended up with either missing the photo or a blurred or wonky pictures.
FEATURE REQUEST
Many settings  but it's missing the shutter opening time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I just need to convince more people to use this great app!
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be awesome if you could add an icon on the main screen indicating the number of sms I didn't read.
FEATURE REQUEST
I hope not to jinx things  but look no further if you need a SMS texting app.
FEATURE REQUEST
(I only wish you could forward messages and more easily set up group messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
Must have app One of the first secure app that I find easy to use and user friendly  which is necessary if we want people to use it!
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great but missing one feature The one thing I would love to see is support for finger print auth to protect opening the app  other than that  works great so far.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish more people would switch so I could use the encryption.
FEATURE REQUEST
Have one missing Feature for an SMS app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't use the end-to-end encryption as I don't always have a data connection and I wish there was a way to default to unencrypted when no data connection is present.
FEATURE REQUEST
An iPhone port with feature and appearance parity would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  just a few tweaks would be very neat: 1.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everyone needs this Really this should just be the new normal sms  too many crooks and feds are listenng in all the time.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish you could customize fonts and window colors.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple & compact I like how you can assign colors to contacts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it was for I-Phones too That way all of my friends and family had it!
FEATURE REQUEST
Will be great if developer make similar email app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Horrible permission For gods sake  i cannot watch youtube because i need to update this first.
FEATURE REQUEST
Miss Any
FEATURE REQUEST
Youtube It is ok but it needs wifi.
FEATURE REQUEST
Reasoning The only reason this is required is the google systems we use are patched almost daily to ensure everyone's device is working to its fullest potential
FEATURE REQUEST
It's Need Good app
FEATURE REQUEST
But some of my important apps need this.
FEATURE REQUEST
told 25mb needed to install update i have 223mb available but told update cant be installed because not enough available wtf
FEATURE REQUEST
Not good Need too much limitations like update permissions and cover a lot of memory for update .
FEATURE REQUEST
So annoying Every time I download a app or update like YouTube it says ""you need to update this app in order to use the other one"".
FEATURE REQUEST
It would of been fine if it wasn't by all the space it takes in you're phone!
FEATURE REQUEST
There must be a massive bug.
FEATURE REQUEST
Google should provide alternate options instead of it
FEATURE REQUEST
The games I play needed this Your awesome google
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add 10 minutes rather
FEATURE REQUEST
WHAT I was trying to play a subway surfers game and it said to download this app I pressed the botton and it showed me to Google play store so I pressed a botton that said install and it started to download
FEATURE REQUEST
Always needed to be updated No matter how many times I update this app it still wants me to update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Every second it needs to be updated.
FEATURE REQUEST
:( Please add light version of it for phone that contain little internal storage.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make a little space for the new version.because I only got 2GB memory on my phone.because I updated my YouTube when I open my youtube something pop-up that I need to update Google Play Service
FEATURE REQUEST
It's awful I needed it for yt so I deleted a app where I had 100 followers  AND IT DIDN'T DOWNLOAD!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good service I needed it badly too
FEATURE REQUEST
Annoying I have to install this because of other apps this thing is stupid don't install
FEATURE REQUEST
Nor that bad but needs some improvement
FEATURE REQUEST
But the PDF plugin needs a lot of work to make reading PDF books smooth.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there's the option in setting where I can choose show/sort book title by file name.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like the text small when I read at home but I need it much bigger when I'm in the car or on the train.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app might not be as polished as the kindle app  but it is packed with more features.
FEATURE REQUEST
Flawless It's only flaw I can think of is the book adding interface - you have to load your collection one by one.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best app ever I Love this app i downloaded it 'cause i needed a app to read these books and now there my favo books thanks to this app
FEATURE REQUEST
It does everything every other book reading app wishes it did  plus some things they don't even know they should be doing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Overall satisfaction Actually this book reader is the only software for reading .epub and .mobi files for free.it could use some improvement and also good gui.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good reader but it needs a better highlighter.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add some additional fonts.
FEATURE REQUEST
One only thing's missing: a couple of paper/wood/else textured backgrounds.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it's rather a caprice than a lack of perfection.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I learned of FBReader a long time ago Has all of the things Kindle Reader lacks.
FEATURE REQUEST
for reading PDF you should add an extra plug in.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app is great for mobi or epub formats but for cbz cbr or pdf you need to zoom and then the scrolling feels awkward also it doesn't load the book properly which is a shame in an otherwise brilliant app
FEATURE REQUEST
The PDF reader needs work I use another reader to PDF the crop option is better there.
FEATURE REQUEST
lack of continuous strolling
FEATURE REQUEST
Landscape It open two pages at landscape but I need zoomed single page .
FEATURE REQUEST
I can access my ebook collection through my Google Drive and I can use the app on multiple phones to access the same collection.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome I have been using this e-reader since I got first android phone back in early 2010 and it is by far the best e-reader app I have come across  wouldn't use any other app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I will raise my rating up to 5 stars once they add Drop Box.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes after closing the app  The book will disappear and I have to search for the book and the page where I read last time to continue my reading.
FEATURE REQUEST
Rather  I had to zoom in on every page in order to read.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs autoscroll Wonderful eBook reader  however auto scroll and perhaps a material design makeover would make this perfect
FEATURE REQUEST
no need to import my books.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its amazing The app does its job perfectly and gives u the extra u need to have to give it 5 stars
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Good  but there must be a site to download more books
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing Please add scroll vieww thank you
FEATURE REQUEST
Good reader  needs annotation tools I did get synching to work between my devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
""Light'' yet you need to install a plugin smh
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app but need to improve I like it coz it's light  smooth.but it's missing auto scrolling that make it not perfect.
FEATURE REQUEST
You can download many top rated books from network library  in addition you can download and add to this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some simple preset modes for phones  medium tablets and large tablets would be nice too.
FEATURE REQUEST
For PDF  ou have to zoom out to original size before you can turn a page.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app Need some more option for user.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but I wish it would store books on The SD card instead of the main storage drive.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding a scrolling option (instead of just page turning  but scrolling pixel by pixel like in Moon) would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very easy and simple You can get any book by downloading it.you need not to buy any book
FEATURE REQUEST
Continuing Plugin issues Tts plugin was installed  but 'speak' option is missing from menu where in a previous version it was present.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not only its buggy but it also need a plugin app to be downloaded for supporting pdf!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wouldn't display the files on windows version either.
FEATURE REQUEST
OK  I guess  but missing stuff Not easy to organize your books.
FEATURE REQUEST
There must not be an app that don't work for all.
FEATURE REQUEST
Reads the formats I need it to.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing that I feel it is missing is the autoscroll.
FEATURE REQUEST
3.8/5 Reduced 1 star because the Bookshelf View (of which the UI could be enhanced) and TTS function is not available with the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it seems to be missing some important features  such as: select a word (such as a name)  and show occurrences with some context  especially the first few  then return to current position; scroll page up and down so any arbitrary line is at the top (or bottom).
FEATURE REQUEST
Fonts Add more fonts for variety
FEATURE REQUEST
One thing please add is that we usually use left hand to read so it is very good if you can make the pages flip by taping on the left of the screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
(new phone) lost a star because u keep changing the app when it's not necessary!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Ads ads and plugins Needs plugins that will show ads for very simple tasks like reading a pdf
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to install so many plugins
FEATURE REQUEST
Not as good as iBooks Doesn't allow you to underline or highlight text or add notes like iBooks does.
FEATURE REQUEST
Loved it....but missing the ""Resize Text"" option!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Cast support It would be Great if the option to cast the book on Chromecast is introduced.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic Works perfect for what I need it for.
FEATURE REQUEST
I uploaded a LOT of books to my OneDrive in ePub so needed an app like this to read them on.
FEATURE REQUEST
Color-dict works okay but inbuilt dictionary with similar theme as of the reader would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it would offer to scan the phone for books you already saved to it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to repeatedly tap zoom in  wait to refresh  zoom in again 10 times to easily read the book.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add synchronization in Linux
FEATURE REQUEST
Please more features I really like this app  but it will be better if have more features like these: 1 - Transparent background for progress indicator  I like page count inside reading page; 2 - Scroll speed  options for 5 to 30 frames in 100-1000ms  so as my device speed  I can choose which is the best page turning.
FEATURE REQUEST
File tree and reading command should be improved.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to be fixed for night reading.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only wish that I have: it would be great to have an iPhone version too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing feature It has no support for epub tables.
FEATURE REQUEST
PREVIOUS REVIEW: This is the best reader out there but I wish I didn't have to update it every two days.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple Yet reads .mobi and .epub  but more textures for the free version would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding mpdules instead of downloading individual apps would save space and maybe RAM
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to cut the trailing space before sending text to the translator.
FEATURE REQUEST
Trash 馃槵 I need to install additional plug in for everything.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  i really want to buy your premium version to thank you but i think the price is too steep for the added features are useless to me.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you can add the function like in ""GrabMyBooks"" app  the i will buy the premium app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add persian(Farsi) to your supported languages.this wonderful app only lacks this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great It would be nice to be able to SYNC position in book that one's reading on multiple devices (i.e. Phone  Tablet and PC)
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but a bit complicated Please add a quick option for day and night settings that is essential for me
FEATURE REQUEST
Thouh the pdf format needs to improve.
FEATURE REQUEST
Reaching - it used to be ""Menu button - Bookmarks - Add""  now it's ""Touch anywhere - Top left corner - Bookmarks - Add"".
FEATURE REQUEST
I was primarily interested because this is one of the few which can read AZW3 (mobipocket) format (besides kindle) but realised rendering of same is not very good  ToC was missing and and the files was depicted rather like a .rtf file.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good software but an option to select chapters would be even better.
FEATURE REQUEST
...lack of good widgets.
FEATURE REQUEST
If it's not the app's fault it needs to let me know what to do to fix it.
FEATURE REQUEST
But missing feature export all highlights from a book to a. text file.
FEATURE REQUEST
So pls add a tool that helps us to cut those white space.
FEATURE REQUEST
..love it People who are fond of reading should be having this book reader.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add a new feature It will be so easy to use if you make an auto scroll button for this delicious app...we love you
FEATURE REQUEST
I tried adding it but don't know where.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
I often use tablet with mouse and keyboard and it will be great if an app supports primitive i\o from these devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app Wish there was text reflow
FEATURE REQUEST
However  wish I could customize the appearance (font  color  size  etc.) and be able to see the changes as I make them  instead of having to change them in a separate screen and having to go back and forth.
FEATURE REQUEST
The best free reader and plug ins let you add only the features you want
FEATURE REQUEST
Better if it could be reduced.
FEATURE REQUEST
almost 5* the local library should be easier to access and the book shelf should have bigger thumbnails
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it has cloud upload option too
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add continuous scrolling in page turning options.
FEATURE REQUEST
It was the first time I needed an app like that and after trying out many of them  I decided this is the best.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hope u can add many background wallpaper.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs an actual bookshelf view  not the one currently offered.
FEATURE REQUEST
And the bookshelf needs to be able to auto load from the external sd card like pocketbooks does and keep the books in author then series order.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sync across devices If it could sync across devices so I dont have to search where I left off from one to the other I would buy it no matter the price.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could install this on my Kindle.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not good for pdf and bugs in library Not really design for pdf  always need to zoom in and out for pdf format  I need to convert all my pdf books to epub format.
FEATURE REQUEST
I should be able to simply put the books into the FBReader directory on my Google Drive and have them appear in the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good for reading Add corousel shelf view for books.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm required to go online every single time I open it to verify my license before I can use it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there were enough plugins so I could uninstall my other readers.
FEATURE REQUEST
need 2nd time touch  annoying issue :(
FEATURE REQUEST
it would be nice to have the old-book effects and colour of the coolreader.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is definitely used by people that actually need a good book reader.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ok  it is a perfect app if the book shelf could be integrated in.
FEATURE REQUEST
best one  almost perfect the only two scenario that I have to switch to other reading app is when I need to write note of what I read  and when I need to have native Chinese simplified to Chinese traditional.
FEATURE REQUEST
Goood Good and slight changes must be done!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
But unless I'm missing it  no widget?
FEATURE REQUEST
if you add some options I'll be ready to get a primary version 1.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ok I wish there was an option to scroll instead of pages.
FEATURE REQUEST
These problems never occurred until last month.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is not a way to lock the page in place after zoom in.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its super amazing and you need to download it nooooow!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Book Catalog How can I add some book catalog manually?
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you adding continous reading at landscape mode or portrayed reading  because when we use handphone with screen display is small (especially pdf) is difficult to read.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  the only weakness is in the lack of support for tables in ePub documents.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is nice for nighttime reading  but a much higher screen brightness level is required (when comparing to version 2.5.5) for reading in any condition other that complete dark.
FEATURE REQUEST
wish the app would save them internally and hide them from the gallery.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it but I miss the old logo!!!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good to read epub n text format Need to improve PDF format.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I looked for an ereader to install on my ASUS Phonepad this was the first app which I tried and since then I didn't try anything else.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have an awesome dict but FBreader doesn't see it and I wish I could at least copy-paste into it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was an east way (nor involving a PC ) to use this App with Amazon  Play and Bol books instead of having to read DRM protected stuff on their substandard reading Apps.
FEATURE REQUEST
But  I wish the bookshelf view would work for each collection instead of all books  much like iOS's does.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also would be nice if you couldn't add the same book twice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes when I add things manually I forget if I added it from x source  and even though the names are the same  it creates a duplicate.
FEATURE REQUEST
Oh another thing that needs to be implemented  NEEDS  is a way to reorganize book positions  for book series and such.
FEATURE REQUEST
I prefer there should be an option to override system sleep time in fb reader like it is with video players
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Plz add multiwindow and pen window support to Galaxy note series.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing some trivial feature like time left and/or page left and total page in a chapter.
FEATURE REQUEST
The author urgently needs more money  so this is now nagware Makes me feel pretty dumb for having encouraged him by paying for Bookshelf
FEATURE REQUEST
And also  I wish it also has a Publisher's Format option so that readers could read exactly how the book was made.
FEATURE REQUEST
鉂?PS: is there a way we can upload our books in the app w/o saving the data in the internal storage?
FEATURE REQUEST
I love the free add- ons of features that some apps charge you for.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I'd known before buying Calibre Companion yesterday  cause this is free!
FEATURE REQUEST
A display brightness problem Why this app doesn't use default display brightness setting and I haven't be able to change it ?
FEATURE REQUEST
It just needs an option to add a list of folders to scan looking for supported books and documents
FEATURE REQUEST
Work great Work great  but I do wish it had a cloud like Google plus  so you can read at all your handhold devices
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if we could open docx files
FEATURE REQUEST
Using for more than 3 years  never needed to switch to another app.
FEATURE REQUEST
The design and usability is great  but I'd like to be able to switch pages back and forth with one hand (e.g. tap top left corner to move one page back and bottom left corner to move one page forth).
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
It could even be paid  I would donate gladly  as FBReader is my mostly used app.

FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
And--most importantly--it just does what you want it to do  bells and whistles optional.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great on my s4  but this 'on' 5  is missing a sensor.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need something on your phone to use it and it's fake
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately  my tablet is missing something for this app.
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
Missing even closest stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
Inaccurate star chart  missing even closest stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it I Need some motion
FEATURE REQUEST
Wasn't Useful I tried it and it said the sun was in front of me.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to go exploring in my back yard.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is so unbelievably cool  you can actually see a real map of the cosmos right over your head!
FEATURE REQUEST
the one thing missing i did not see the ISS .
FEATURE REQUEST
should add it also since many would like to see with naked eye once its passing by your part of sky.
FEATURE REQUEST
Doesn't move Had to recalibrate the compass several times before it finally started working.
FEATURE REQUEST
Although  it would be nice if it provided notifications for rare celestial to events ( in few days advance).
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm so sorry about the comment  I though it was the application but actually it was my phones  now I can use this app with my new phone which is the LG Tribune 5.
FEATURE REQUEST
Old Sky Map worked so much better New update needs to have a gyro in your phone  my tablet doesn't.
FEATURE REQUEST
Calibration issues and overlay Needs work for marshmallow
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it was better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be beyond amazing if devs could please add a VR cardboard option!
FEATURE REQUEST
Why there are no satellites of the planets?
FEATURE REQUEST
It just does the job very well and that is what we need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I had this back in school as a kid!
FEATURE REQUEST
Instead of turning gyro on by default it should ask the user when started whether it should be turned on.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome app I retract my earlier review i learned how to fix it..i learned that i needed to keep my location (gps) on during use of this app and now its very accurate.sorry about the bad review it was my own mistake.this is an awesome app and i highly recomend it if u r interested in the amazingly vast and awesome universe.i know i am and i hope u do too.remember thats where we came from.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works Really needed an app for my astronomy class and this is perfect
FEATURE REQUEST
No calibration Seen Tue app through a friend I have a zte warp LTE and its not working for me would love to use this app
FEATURE REQUEST
If Everyone would use a little common sense and their eyes and look you'd see the Earth is flat.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really like this app I only wish it was accurate the sun is setting in the west & it's telling me the sun is on the other side of the world this app is B.S.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app labeled the constellation Sagittarius as Capricorn  and Andromeda was not only missing  but the entire Pegasus constellation as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to have info on starts and planets  the ability to click on them to get some basic info and distance from earth
FEATURE REQUEST
missing info no info about object on the map  e.g. magnitude  coordinates .
FEATURE REQUEST
Then an update happened and now the compass needs calibrating but never gets higher than low accuracy.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need some more improvement Please add live view of Milky Way to check its current location which help the astro photographers.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think we need a new version.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could just add Comet ISON.
FEATURE REQUEST
Where's the VR This would be great with VR.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to add some description of stars It would be nice to look up some description of stars from the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
A new icon would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great What more do you need to get started in understanding the constellations
FEATURE REQUEST
They can also use this to know where to find planets at a star gazing party.
FEATURE REQUEST
Allows to search a specific celestial body (but you need to remember the name as you have to type it; I could not find a list of celestial bodies  list that is available with SkEye) and shows on the screen an arrow allowing to orientate the screen towards the searched body.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is not always clear if the GPS position has locked correctly: it is necessary to use an other application to check that the GPS position is being acquired properly (SkEye shows when starting the GPS status with number of visible and used satellites and informs when a GPS position has been acquired properly).
FEATURE REQUEST
Not accurate at all I can deal with calibrating every time it needs to be opened  but not when it's clearly inaccurate.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to see it in VR  are there any plans for this?
FEATURE REQUEST
Hemispheres I like it but need to find out how to swap hemispheres.
FEATURE REQUEST
Expand you view Never new I could be so amazed at an apps this actually tells u where the stars r..
FEATURE REQUEST
Older devices should be able to use this app too since it is so good!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had a help page .
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be better with art
FEATURE REQUEST
I think they should change the title screen  they can do better than that.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also I'd suggest you make it possible to select a cluster or nebula on the map to see a gallery photo.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm using a samung galexy ace II & it is only on this phone can i use the star map.
FEATURE REQUEST
Two small changes that would be nice - 1) some way of highlighting the milky way & 2) an indication of which hemisphere is which.
FEATURE REQUEST
My only wish was that it would show more info on the messier objects.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding location tracking Not updating
FEATURE REQUEST
Sky map It's the there when I need it
FEATURE REQUEST
I guess my phone is missing a sensor.
FEATURE REQUEST
The gyro support works like a dream  interface could use a little modernising and I would happily pay for a Google cardboard version.
FEATURE REQUEST
Thank you very much needed enhancement.
FEATURE REQUEST
Gyro Update a Revelation I have long enjoyed this app but on recent phones or was almost unusable unless you turned it to manual.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to get a telescope again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Star names clutter map It would be nice if I could turn off star names but still see the stars themselves.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't have to regret anymore :D REPLY FROM DEV FOR MY PREVIOUS REVIEW: Not at all - it needs the compass too.
FEATURE REQUEST
The gyroscope only detects speed  you still need the compass to 'anchor' the device on North.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish this app was around 20 years ago!
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for adding that enhancement...it will be much more enjoyable to use Sky Map now.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is being updated by volunteers and under the circumstances I hope they keep up this wonderful work this app has a lot of potential it keeps our family going outside and looking up at this beautiful Universe we belong to  if there is some way we can sponsor these Volunteers and perhaps donate  I wish they would post it as I would encourage the further development of this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's amazing what you can find with this app!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish all apps worked as well so this
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to add There has been declared that there are 3-4 new planets  please add these and there are 2-3 darf planets.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if there were links for planet  star  etc information
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it showed the ISS Cool app  but would love to see the ISS added
FEATURE REQUEST
Compass absent I used to love it but now it Says I don't have a compass that I need to do it manually
FEATURE REQUEST
Map is off 45 degrees if i could get the manual location settings to set the exact position i bet it would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but pretty useless to identify anything in the sky because my new Moto G4 Plus lacks a compass.
FEATURE REQUEST
Isn't there another way for the app to know where it's looking at?
FEATURE REQUEST
Not accurate It would be cool  if it actually worked.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I had this 20 years ago.
FEATURE REQUEST
Easy to use while adding education in a fun way.
FEATURE REQUEST
Constantly loosing track Constantly have to clear the app data because it looses track where it is and show the incorrect position of the stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to update in order to catch up with other alternatives.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app But could be better if it could be viewed in cardboard.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app I wish it dealt with light pollution too
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add this feature?
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be better to make the compass calibration easier coz the current method made me drop my phone twice and I still couldn't successfully complete it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Simple and just what need to find what that light is in the sky.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not Great You guys really need to fix this because it's WAY off
FEATURE REQUEST
Does not calibrate Tried for 30 min.
FEATURE REQUEST
Said something one of the times that something wasn't permissible not sure what I went to quick and ended up skipping over it I wish I could figure out what happened cause I loved it
FEATURE REQUEST
:p jk keep up the great work...btw please add some learning tools and histrory of the stars etc. :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app  but it needs a legend.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs a new icon
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish that they would update its appearance  because for the most part it looks like it's from the pre-ICS era (which it is).
FEATURE REQUEST
Calibration needs work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could put this on my iPad.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks a lot of features.
FEATURE REQUEST
I couldn't get this app to show me the galaxies and it won't show me anything i need to see!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could enjoy this app like everyone else.
FEATURE REQUEST
I do wish I could click on a constellation/planet and get info about it's astrology/Greek mythology for greater learning power
FEATURE REQUEST
can you do the same for the ISS?
FEATURE REQUEST
Although I have no complaints about this app  it would really be cool if you could read info about a certain star  constellation  planet and etc by tapping on it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It immediately recognized my compass needed calibration so it could work better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Somewhat good but Needs a way to calabrate without a compass so it shows stars in their proper spots.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing stars names The app does not have names of many of the stars
FEATURE REQUEST
A fantastic way to explore the night Now it just needs a Material Design update and it's perfect!
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish it could pin point where your at and then you put in an address or long and lat so it'll tell you what star to follow.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs Satalite tracker Needs to be a satalite tracker to find satellites in real time
FEATURE REQUEST
Your phone needs a compass to enjoy properly.
FEATURE REQUEST
App hangs Wish I could give 0 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish they flipped so I can tip back and be able to read the star names.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add more star names
FEATURE REQUEST
But still I wish it were 100% accurate.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love this app One request plz add more features and images and information in this application tx
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
This app reminds you of what you're missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Awesome app guys  though I think Pluto's photo needs an update!
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Please add details about planet.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be cool to get better view of planets moons and things.
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately even many of the constellation stars seem to be missing names.
FEATURE REQUEST
I know most stars don't have cool names  but it'd be nice top be able to see what they're called (and didn't they used to show up when you zoomed in on them?
FEATURE REQUEST
Hopefully one day you will be able to create a widget for this app.
