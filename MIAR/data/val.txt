FEATURE REQUEST
It's good for the times you need low brightness for night reading  but for God's sake people  just change the brightness in the notifications panel and skip the extra power draw this app causes.

FEATURE REQUEST
Only icon theme is missing Please add icon/theme in your next update.

Changed from cyanogenmod to Lg G5's stock  needed something similiar.

Why cm 13 is not coming the developer should add themes of CyanogenMod so we could enjoy more...
FEATURE REQUEST
Any Rom This will work on any Android Rom but except for Crome os  Remix os and Phenix os
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it but it needs the ability to change icons This would be my go to launcher for sure if there was the ability to use icon packs including icon masks.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add smart folders option.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed CM launcher in OP2  as it was better than stock launcher.
FEATURE REQUEST
But could you tell me if i can add cyanogen themes to it?
FEATURE REQUEST
Not bad I miss having a rooted phone because trebuchet was a really nice launcher.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way I can auto rotate now is by changing build.prop.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing some features though It works wondefully!
FEATURE REQUEST
Fast and very handy Loved the icon size   but app drawer needs more improvements to make it effective
FEATURE REQUEST
thankss..please add ok google voice recognition.

Also could be even nicer if you can add the changes from cm13.
FEATURE REQUEST
Will be good to see those scrolling white pages again .
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice launcher  just need a white search bar just like Google in marshmallow.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missed the launcher of my cyanogen phone on the oxygen OS.
FEATURE REQUEST
It will be better if you add icon pack settings and hide app ability.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you do something about stock icons?
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing Great Launcher would have given 5stars of we could have the possibility to hide apps
FEATURE REQUEST
It's a really great launcher...but I wish this app had icon packs....more icon customization plzzz make this happen.

To make it possible to use on a OnePlus Two with OxygenOS.

If only you could add the feature of hiding app icons  that'd make it one of the best launcher for me!

I just wish if you could add a swipe to right to launch Google Now just like Google Now launcher.
FEATURE REQUEST
awesome would love the ability to change icon's

If possible it would be great to add an option for the horizontal app drawer to have a dark background

FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it was type of business specific I find my self choosing other all the time.
FEATURE REQUEST
A construction category would be nice.

FEATURE REQUEST
Geat app but needs to save info in cloud
FEATURE REQUEST
Easy I needed an easy way to keep track of all my expenses.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I'd been using this for the last few years.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple UI and Functional It is missing a few things that would be helpful.
FEATURE REQUEST
I might only suggest one added custom list.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some features like recognition and a little more flexibility in the report format would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
We travel a lot and need to keep track of all expenses on the road to claim back the tax and expenses.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good app that does what I need to manage my expense receipts while traveling.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to keep track of expenses for 3 different small businesses.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great tool This does everything you need to do receipts
FEATURE REQUEST
Basic things missing Great job so far!
FEATURE REQUEST
Guess I need to find something else.
FEATURE REQUEST
OCR would be nice and see it is in the works.
FEATURE REQUEST
Understand it can be done in comments but would be nice to have a DB of job or PO numbers to select from.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love for it to sync between my phone and tablet  hopefully that will come in future update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  I wish it displayed the trip total when you're within a trip.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cropping Great App but I wish I had the ability to crop the receipts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Another good feature would be the ability to merge a page from an existing PDF document such as airfare receipts.
FEATURE REQUEST
Tried the free version and noticed that it was missing something that would be very useful to me.
FEATURE REQUEST
It now is perfect for the reports I need to run for my work expenses.
FEATURE REQUEST
I operate a sole proprietorship  so I need reliable and efficient business tools to save time and hassle.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love the totals helps make sure I havent missed anything.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App Would be nice to have desktop access too.
FEATURE REQUEST
This way  it is also a good check as I can see if I get the same number in both systems to see if I made a fat finger mistake.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it was just a few clicks shorter to create a report.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be cool if there was a Web page listing future features users could vote to have developed/fixed next.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Would be 5 star if you could post credits on the statement
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect I wish the app had a way to auto backup to drop box or Google drive like once every 24 hours or if it could be kept in sync whenever you opened or closed the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent app and good service Meets my need for an app to quickly store receipts  and extract the receipts images when I need them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent app..does exactly what I need to do..and developer is great on getting back to you on any issues you may have.
FEATURE REQUEST
Bought the paid version to support the developer  as he was so helpful when I needed support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  everyone should have This app is great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'll be able to write more off on my taxes next year because of this
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to submit images of my receipts on a weekly basis.
FEATURE REQUEST
Basics missing Can't create new categories  doesn't sync when installed on another device  also would be nice to have entry entered on calendar if one desired.
FEATURE REQUEST
Note 7 notification grouping problem Not pissible to display two notifications at same time  please add all 8 cores plus frequency in one icon!
FEATURE REQUEST
If you do are for the cause ""OS Monitor"" might be a better fit.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some may not like it  or just add an option for it.
FEATURE REQUEST
The beauty of seeing an icon in the status bar (and the notifications list) is that you can track your battery usage in real-time and kill (or uninstall) processes before they drain your battery.
FEATURE REQUEST
The missing instrument for flying Lollipop Loving the icon.
FEATURE REQUEST
Feature suggestion On my Galaxy S6 edge plus only shows the speed of the 4 1.5 cores I would also like to see the speed of the 4 2.1 cores.
FEATURE REQUEST
More than 4 cores Really nice app  would be nice to have more than 4 cores in one box instead of 2 boxes
FEATURE REQUEST
Good monitoring Would like to see speed of other cores
FEATURE REQUEST
Extra Hai dev  just a request if you can add up cpu temperature as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think the graph should be at 100% usage in relation to max cpu.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to be able to enable permanent usage view for both cores  or revert to the previous version I used on my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Possible you can add an option to change the color(s) of the CPU usage in the statusbar.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to see an update to this app cause it really is well done otherwise.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needed to use Auto Memory Manager to stop Kitkat from constantly killing this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great But can you add Samsung Exynos 7420 (octa-core) support?
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish it had a good task manager built in.
FEATURE REQUEST
It always had to be something more than simply a ""cloud stored"" bookmark that you could optionally share.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still usable but that is something that needs fixing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nearly perfect Only missing a dark theme for the main view.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it would retain the authentication token after reboot  but I can see that is also a security risk.
FEATURE REQUEST
A Pinboard account is required.
FEATURE REQUEST
Understandably this is a Android limitation It would be super if this could resolve address.local names in a future update.
FEATURE REQUEST
You can simply swipe down and it will give you all the details u need to know.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you need a good barcode scanner  this is where you should start.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just one other function u guys should add  i.e. touch focus.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best barcode scanner and creator It does everything you need  ad free and fast!
FEATURE REQUEST
Need a way to share a photo or other image into the app  rescale  recenter  and scan a Barcode.
FEATURE REQUEST
No place does it guids you were to finde it please help.
FEATURE REQUEST
The UI needs to be modernized to be within the material design specifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app also needs to allow portrait mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
good app  but Plz add front light shortcut icon on main screen  like toggle switch
FEATURE REQUEST
Fix the orientation Needs to be able to use the scanner in both landscape and portrait mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes you need to scan something that is open and you cannot because the scanner cannot be turned on its side as it it will reorientate itself making it impossible to scan the item
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to hold my phone very still to work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also need to have barcode item on a surface.
FEATURE REQUEST
A material design would be good too.
FEATURE REQUEST
As Winston Churchill said: ""A barcode scanner should be good  easy to use  and free""
FEATURE REQUEST
Still does its job While the look is a bit outdated and possibly needs an update  the functionality is still there.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would really be useful if the program could add the barcode and the internet listing to a text file  so you can efficiently catalog products in your home.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nobody will be able to touch you even if they attack you first!
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to mail all the scannings to my work email.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can't imagine why you need access to my contacts!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
That will be the day you need to scan something.
FEATURE REQUEST
High quality app Just wish it had more qr code types in the share menu for generating codes.
FEATURE REQUEST
QR & Barcode Scanner from Gamma Pay only needs access to camera.
FEATURE REQUEST
Helpfull Please add Qr/barcode picture scanner.thanks
FEATURE REQUEST
i want to get history but when i go to history tab i can't to see any history of scanned what can i do ?
FEATURE REQUEST
Works for me The only issue is I can't determine how to 'select camera manually' as it says in the app update; I need to do this on one device.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Works great for me could really use a manual entry for item that may not scan do to bad barcodes.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app is good  but need updates.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's good and quick but would love a option for portrait mode instead of havr landscape only.
FEATURE REQUEST
So I would literally have to wait until my phone died to use it again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Helpful I really appreciate that you put It into other apps I really need it for book catalogue it is a very good application.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love it and I will have the best time put into this app especially with book catalogue because I need to scan barcode's.
FEATURE REQUEST
Two must be hidden!
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs updating  Samsung 7s
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't understand why this app needs do many permissions.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think more user-interface elements should wear interesting underwear.
FEATURE REQUEST
Helpful It cam in handy when I needed to see what the product I was buying was
FEATURE REQUEST
Needed to know serial number on my bike was missing a letter couldn't read it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nyc app Add a feature to Scan from photos in gallery also Barcode and qr code generator.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no reason for this app to need to read my personal data  Web browser history  and bookmarks.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works well  but wish it worked horizontally.
FEATURE REQUEST
Like it I know now you need a good camera to be able to scan it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It won't read my barcodes no matter how many times I try so for you people out there that need this app I'm sorry but this app is a no go.
FEATURE REQUEST
I will be able to do it Well the first place and time of reading and the other side of my life.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is another way: edit the scanning layer (that oscillating red bar) you add to camera so that it contains a pre scanned barcode.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no way to import the image into the scanner.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not what I need The app BookScouter had me install this.
FEATURE REQUEST
5 when you add portrait mode
FEATURE REQUEST
Every time I need to scan in the QR code at the boys station to see where the bus is  I never can if there is a lot of sunlight.
FEATURE REQUEST
Average You should add the option to scan a code saved on phone gallery.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does not work I got this app thinking it would be good but it does not scan anything waste of time downloading do not download dosent work.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't think that it will work I think this is fake
FEATURE REQUEST
Not too shabby It works good  but need lot of improvements and feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to improve Considered
FEATURE REQUEST
Google prompts users to install this app when adding a key using QR code feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it could do number recognition too.
FEATURE REQUEST
We can use it anytime anywhere.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app is simply perfect I needed to know what a barcode meant.In less than a minute I was able to download this app  scan the code and look up the code's meaning online.
FEATURE REQUEST
But  when i disable auto-focus  i need to trigger the auto-focus once  maybe with touching the screen and keep that focus distance for next scan.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add such feature ?
FEATURE REQUEST
Waste of space on your phone You would think common sense would dictate with the development of a barcode scanner you would be able to scan A image online or in your photo gallery or a snapshot common sense dictate!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Will not scan I try to put the darn thing in the rectangle and it wont scan i hate it 1 star
FEATURE REQUEST
Works well but missing feature Need to be able to scan from an image saved on phone  not just from the camera
FEATURE REQUEST
It is bs that this app needs my contacts and call log  among other bits of personal information it doesn't really need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Gread app But it will be very good if you add a flash light button on screen
FEATURE REQUEST
Interface could use an update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Install if you need the functionality.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add gps location to history.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to file scan with notes
FEATURE REQUEST
I only suggest to add the option to turn the flash on.
FEATURE REQUEST
An android necessity I've been using this app since I first needed to scan a barcode ages ago.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only wish it supported more code formats.
FEATURE REQUEST
Helpful I think this app is very helpful and useful but some items to not have a description over all good app
FEATURE REQUEST
This isn't all that bad but  we need a lot more item scans.
FEATURE REQUEST
I know that's probably not the app's fault but it would be better if the app gave an accurate product search immediately after scanning without me pressing the button.
FEATURE REQUEST
Makes you look up price on internet  hit or miss cause the sites don't give you the price:(
FEATURE REQUEST
Deactivated autofocus places the focus at infinity (because we all know that barcodes must be scanned from 5 meters from the scanner.)
FEATURE REQUEST
I will use it for the app I need it for and remove it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Every time I tried to use the Barcode scanner  I received an error message stating I needed an Internet connection although I was connected.
FEATURE REQUEST
Never ever worked for me  really needed this app  but after numerous trys on different products with no results  I gave up
FEATURE REQUEST
Intrusive permissions Why the hell does this app need my app history  browsing history  bookmarks  contacts  .
FEATURE REQUEST
Permissions disappoint I wish I could opt out of sharing my entire contact list with this app!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Its very good but it would be even better if the name of countries were clearer
FEATURE REQUEST
Other than that it's ok would be better if I didn't need to give access to contacts
FEATURE REQUEST
Code may need to be updated  otherwise  amazing app
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to scan books on Amazon  only worked with Google Books so missed over half of books  rarely would show book cover.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very bad I need portrait rotation.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if I could scan a code that is already in my phone as an image.
FEATURE REQUEST
Downloaded cause Google authenticator told me I needed it
FEATURE REQUEST
Good But need to more grow.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding google shopper helps.
FEATURE REQUEST
Google really needs to make their own rather than recommending this app.It is so flaky.
FEATURE REQUEST
It works This app does what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
This could be done via the taskwarrior context command.
FEATURE REQUEST
- Allow the user to override the system default font size to select smaller / larger text in the report viewer.
FEATURE REQUEST
Brought me back to taskwarrior Left taskwarrior years ago because I needed my task list on my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works pretty well  but it would be great if we could set the increments that the volume changes  rather than it being linear.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very Useful With Tasker 5 stars for adding a Tasker plugin.
FEATURE REQUEST
Superb app with features Super app but it still needs to improve gui ....it should be attractive
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs to have some settings where we can change number or background colour
FEATURE REQUEST
With no ads and free use as icing on the cake  this is a quality app that does only exactly what you need it to do  reliably and easily.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not bad I wish it wouldn't vibrate each time I increased the number  but other than that it's fine.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if the increment/decrement values could be changed  but that's not a huge deal.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app lets you make multiple counters that you can bounce back and forth between so it is perfect for tracking all the different shinies that I hunt for in increments!
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make a widget to go with it?
FEATURE REQUEST
Copy button for perfection Just add a little copy button at the top pls then it will be perfect.
FEATURE REQUEST
And if you can give the option of dividing the + & - buttons left-right respectively with the - button smaller  so theres no more need to look while clicking
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice It would be better if you could place a scientific calculator widget unless its in the calculator pro app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Though I wish there were more functionalities in it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very nice But icon not so good should be changed.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be good if we could copy results from the widget through
FEATURE REQUEST
beautiful but could be more powerful 5-stars and one very happy customer if you add a multiline RPN capability!
FEATURE REQUEST
Result dialogue disappears if code goes out of view so you're stuffed if code is on a moving object; really needs a hold/pause button on it to keep it til you cancel it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Clean and simple Does what I need it to without overcomplicated and invasive features.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  Many meanings are missing pls update this app
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add more words
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be better to display related words in the bottom when we start to type in the search box.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add new and up to date words.
FEATURE REQUEST
We need more efforts like these.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Need to add more words
FEATURE REQUEST
Some common words meanings are also missing from this dictionary.
FEATURE REQUEST
It will be great if you add an option for viewing History of Searched Words.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be a great help if you can add it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but many word are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
So many words are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very Good Add pronunciation of English words too.Add Provision for grouping favorite words.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if you added malayalam to malayalam support like you have done with the web site
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app Very useful and fast app same like online version ....add more words..thank you
FEATURE REQUEST
And plz also add list of words  both English and malayalam.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best malayalam dictionary However  if you just add text predictions.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if you enabled malayalam pronunciation like what in web edition
FEATURE REQUEST
Prompt result offline dictionary I think  if there's a 'search history' that would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
It'll be so nice if you add Malayalam to English too
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you please add auto fill words while typing as we are really missing the same.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some words are missing Also it would be great If it shows the pronunciation of the words
FEATURE REQUEST
Should have pronunciation also .
FEATURE REQUEST
Many words missing!
FEATURE REQUEST
but some words are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Many words are missing Having no updates makes this app a limited reliable source.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add the voice search service
FEATURE REQUEST
Few necessary things missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
The simple solution is to make it only connect in a familiar location AND when there's a preferred network in range.
FEATURE REQUEST
Crashes a lot on android 6.0 Recently it crashes a lot on android 6.0  probably lacks complete support but worked as expected before I upgrade  still recommended for anyone who is not using android 6.0
FEATURE REQUEST
That being said the configuration is super easy so adding a new tower to my safe list is a breeze.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'll probably have to cut down my usage of the app because I'm switching to Project Fi but I suggest this app to anyone out there looking to add a little extra security and probably some battery life.
FEATURE REQUEST
I had like 64 pictures and it deleted it all and there is no way I can get it back.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if this is going to be fixed!
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I need to find a replacement for what this app did so flawlessly for years.
FEATURE REQUEST
Texts lumped together so need to search by person  words  or dates  unless want to browse thru long groups of conversations w each person.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works Please add contact backup also.
FEATURE REQUEST
Back up for me when I needed it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Slow and misses many messages This prgram shows lots of promise - i like the fact that all my sms ate now in Google mail as a sub folder.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app always worked for me  however I switched to the iPhone6s and wish you made it available for iPhones :/
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be cool only restore a day's worth of messages if using sim in multiple devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish all the app were as light and efficient as this one.
FEATURE REQUEST
But given that  SMS Backup + is the *only* and best solution to the problem of needing to backup your texts  MMS messages  and even your call log straight to your gmail account.
FEATURE REQUEST
But when I need to retrieve a text I log onto Gmail and I always find what I need!
FEATURE REQUEST
In truth I forget it's there until I need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Where's it gone I've been backing up for ages and restoring successfully when I've changed phones but now I've got a new phone and when I try to install this to get my messages back it won't install.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there any other way I can my messages back?
FEATURE REQUEST
Don't get me wrong SMS Backup & Restore is excellent but as a technology enthusiast who switches phones like underwear I seriously wish this was in my life earlier.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add an option to backup only over wifi
FEATURE REQUEST
I would however  like an option to restore the last x weeks or months of SMS  not the last x quantity of SMS.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish i could choose longer intervals for automatic backup  for example evey 3 days  or every week.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app It is a very useful application when you need to have evidence from your texts and phone calls ;)
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to have the number included in the subject line.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have a bad memory so if I ever need to look up an old message I can!
FEATURE REQUEST
This is useful because we need to select and backup some banking smss' that do not contain a contact number.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic Works perfectly for how you need it to work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there any way I can get notification?
FEATURE REQUEST
That is generally amazing for any app  it does what it says and has saved me when I needed a bit of info but deleted the text in my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed this after getting a new iPhone and didn't want to just wipe all of my conversations.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it would include both contact & app backup.
FEATURE REQUEST
Must have app on your phone but it would be much more useful if you guys add whatsapp backup also.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only missed calls is backing up.
FEATURE REQUEST
Keeps my texts safe Have needed to recover my texts several times when resetting my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
what can I do?
FEATURE REQUEST
Doesn't backup SMS in one shot I've been having to do multiple backups because this application doesn't backup SMS completely in one shot.
FEATURE REQUEST
I recently used it to backup/restore texts bc I needed to reset my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
If restoring and the internet connection is interrupted it'd be nice if the app had a pause/resume function?
FEATURE REQUEST
My single observation is that it should be able to store SMS in GCal  optionally to & instead of GMail inbox (just as it happens with the call log).
FEATURE REQUEST
And I add myself to those who ask for a time-interval restoring functionality.
FEATURE REQUEST
After that  I forget about its existence until I need an old text  and then I thank god I have it and forget it again.
FEATURE REQUEST
WhatsApp Support fork I use this App in its version 1.5.9 as you recommend to keep the WhatsApp support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Every time  when I need to restore latest massages I have to restore older ones too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Used to be amazing till update This always did well backing up what I needed from my messenger.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing timestamps Copying to another same model phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
To the best of my knowledge  there is no way to simply find the new missing messages to restore instead of restoring ALL messages first  If I switch SiM cards  and want to keep my SMS updated  I have to wait for my phone to go through every SMS message I've backed up to catch the ~30 that are new and missed from my other phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I didn't have a problem before  it backed up fine (I would do it manually) and it would show the conversations in my gmail.
FEATURE REQUEST
That's the only reason I needed it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need them.
FEATURE REQUEST
It didn't backup any mms and some messages were missing in conversations.
FEATURE REQUEST
It should have the functionality like Google contacts in deleting contents.
FEATURE REQUEST
Definitely recommend to my colleague who working in law firm as we always need to screenshot sms page by page for clients.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
App should have both way sync option.
FEATURE REQUEST
It should have Google drive as backup location instead of Gmail.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just need to get back on track!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but I wish I could set it to back up both sent and received messages immediately after it is received.
FEATURE REQUEST
If the auto scheduled backup isn't working  you'll need to disable it from automatic power saving mode performed by your phone in your power settings.
FEATURE REQUEST
Solid text messaging backup app I've been using this app for several years and I would definitely suggest it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love the ability to filter certain SMS messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish they would make this for iOS devices too though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Until you need that backup!
FEATURE REQUEST
Any and all assistance would be great whether I use a computer or my samsung 5 active phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I use this app whenever I get a bit antsy and need to flash a new ROM on a new phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I consider this an essential tool for anyone who needs to record their SMS communication.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to copy it to computer.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wouldn't use any other backup app after using this
FEATURE REQUEST
It says it needs to change the permissions in the default app  which it does.
FEATURE REQUEST
Always there I have used this app for years and it always seems to work perfect and once installed I forget it is there till I need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Use to backup automatically but since long time now auto back up is not at all working .need to do it each and every time manually.
FEATURE REQUEST
or we need to look for others
FEATURE REQUEST
So you have to change it to never  so it won't idle the app and it will continue to backup when it's supposed to!
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing about 2 months of text messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed those messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
Between Google Photos and this app  I have all I need to flash custom ROMs without any loss!
FEATURE REQUEST
I need this app so much.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only thing wish I could select exactly which messages I want it to restore that way it won't take hours and I get exactly what I want.
FEATURE REQUEST
And also select backup would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Backup on Dropbox Plz add this option to backup
FEATURE REQUEST
It's very intuitive and actually helped me with a legal situation I was in because I needed texts from 2 years ago so just pulled up my gmail account  and lo and behold they were there.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love an update to Material UI Awesome app but would love an update to Material.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's not backing up new messages and the last message backed up was weeks ago and it insists there's nothing to backup despite the fact that there are easily thousands of messages that need backing up.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
For work i need records of sms and the save format is so good.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app This app works perfectly specially for people who are going through issues with someone else and need to keep documentation.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish it would backup group chats properly  instead of scattering the messages across different threads depending on the author (and MMS restore would be great too).
FEATURE REQUEST
I advise anyone to check when the app last time made backup for your messages or you might have some data losses.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good I needed to reset my phone and I used this app to hold my messages through email and it work all my messages and phone history saved
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish it was a bit quicker.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome app Add a search feature within the app and this would be the ultimate backup app out there.
FEATURE REQUEST
Restore options could be improved Would be nice to have a few more options in restore (from contacts only  date range  more than 500 but less than the 30k I have backed up.
FEATURE REQUEST
SELECT BACKUP OR YOU NEED TO REINSTALL FOR FIRST TIME BACKUP!!
FEATURE REQUEST
The search is over It really does what it needs to do.
FEATURE REQUEST
which are normally the messages that need to be retained.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if it can backup contacts also to it's google drive or any other drive.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is a great app My phone has been messing up on me and I've been really worried about losing some of my sms messages I tried a few other apps and they only wanted to do one message at a time I downloaded and installed this one and it allowed me to backup all of my messages to my gmail account I wish I had this app 3 months ago thank you so much
FEATURE REQUEST
Lost all my group messages I was under the impression that it does MMS messages  and group messages  so I used it  reset my phone  and now all group messages and pictures in messages are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
It works great but have a number it won't backup and really need that one to back up not sure why
FEATURE REQUEST
Does nothing Tried to back up  says successful but no saved files  no emails  nothing .
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you shed some insight about this issue because as per understanding all the SMS should be automatically/manually uploaded in specially designated label for SMS i.e. SMS.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app I have been using this app for a couple of years does everything you need it to.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works as advertised I needed it to backup my sms during phone wipe.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be even better if it would backup whatsapp conversations too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does what it says Very useful little tool that I found and used when I was trying out some custom ROMs.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have my sms and mms backed up to my email automatically so whenever I need to reset my phone I still have my messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there a way to delete old backups?
FEATURE REQUEST
Proper archives of group MMS conversations would be really nice because those are the conversations I'm most likely to want to delete from my phone (it lags when opening a long group MMS thread).
FEATURE REQUEST
Just what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
However i would appreciate if the backup interval could be changed to something longer than just 24 hours - preferable once per week for me.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  would be perfect if can bring back whatsapp :)
FEATURE REQUEST
When restoring sms an option should be given to how many or which sms to restore.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there were more stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way to get both halves of the conversation is to back up form ""everybody"" then I have to go in to gmail and delete those I don't want.
FEATURE REQUEST
Local backup  Contacts and Call history backup support There should be an option to backup locally as a xml file .
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app need improvement Can use more than one phone without loose call log and sms BUT sync not always success and don't items are not aligned if more devices add item after sync data
FEATURE REQUEST
Way to go If you need to access old messages  I can only recommend this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works but doesn't It backs up and sends to my email awsome only problem is it only saves my msgs and not the person that I designated it to save so when I go to look at msgs it looks like I'm talking to myself and I really need the other persons
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Material Design.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic  i wish i knew this app earlier.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need this in my iPhone
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App I never have to worry if something is deleted off my phone!
FEATURE REQUEST
Simply store them on an SD card.would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing any recent possibly important messages
FEATURE REQUEST
did not backup received sms when i tried to backup all my sms  it was saving both incoming and outgoing sms  but when i wanted to save conv with select contacts  it saved only the outgoing msgs.not happy!
FEATURE REQUEST
I never need to use the restore feature since I can just go into my Gmail to access old texts.
FEATURE REQUEST
It works  but I wished it were smart enough to do the delta.
FEATURE REQUEST
Must be download It's a good app and must be download it right now
FEATURE REQUEST
If you use your phone for business and need to be able to look back from time to time this is the best way too be able to.
FEATURE REQUEST
But i need to add watsapp   viper and line massage
FEATURE REQUEST
this is the one missing piece of Android that lets me confidently upgrade phones
FEATURE REQUEST
Need tuning Could you fasten the backing up speed
FEATURE REQUEST
but tool should have one more option when it backed up  removed from the mobile the original or it could be a optional paramater if user desires it can enable
FEATURE REQUEST
I would suggest to have a restore by time duration feature as in restore my sms from the past year
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost there It would be great if the dev would create another app with root permissions to backup whatsapp messages as earlier.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if whatsapp is also added
FEATURE REQUEST
Easy  fast and convenient Fast transfer between android devices once app is downloaded and you have your Gmail info stored...lifesaver for people who need to keep numerous texts stored and have an alternative to carrier back up options.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm on 24/7 on call - there are times that I need to refer back to coworker messages to resolve issues.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simply Awesome I needed to backup my phone prior to doing a factory reset.
FEATURE REQUEST
please add it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Whtasapp backup must be included.
FEATURE REQUEST
Yes  it backs up but one main critical thing it is missing is the timestamp from the original message.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm using this app in my divorce to record my ex wife's texts to me  I would be nice if there was a time stamp so I can show when I received a message.
FEATURE REQUEST
So now I don't have to worry about missing my back ups no more.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can search the email if I need to review past texts.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's fantastic  easy to set up  and after that you can just let it do its thing.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love this app bc it backs up everything I need...but now it's not working right!
FEATURE REQUEST
I really need to back up both sides of the conversation.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great I needed a good backup for goggle hangout sms and this works great
FEATURE REQUEST
Instead of adding more app backup.
FEATURE REQUEST
I text the same people all the time  would be nice if it combined all text/SMS from that day by person.
FEATURE REQUEST
If I was going to spend any money on the app  I wouldn't now due to lack of response from developer.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed these texts for a court hearing but this app was useless!
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't believe it restored all my messages so I need to try again  but can't wait that long every time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing The best sms back up app  I wish you could choose certain contacts to back up though
FEATURE REQUEST
And when it does  it is usually missing some calls
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent Need not to worry about the existence of the mobile.
FEATURE REQUEST
Going from a MOTO X to a Galaxy S5  neither brand's migrating app would work with the other phone; and AT&T's app needs LOTS of work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does a great job Has over the years saved many important conversations from vanishing into the dark after mobiles broke down or otherwise needed to be replaced.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have 27k SMS and I hate that if the program fails at the 20k restoration point  the restoration needs to be started all over again...and over.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not useful Lack of ehatsapp support made this a terrible and useless app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to back-up both recieved texts and sent Now this app doesn't work on my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
But I really wish it handled group messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app/request This app is great  the only thing I wish it had was an option.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could give it a minus 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
I do wish it didn't split them into threads of 100 but that's the only complaint I have.
FEATURE REQUEST
No good After you backup your sms this app will ask you pay to higher version to restore your sms
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't know why anyone wouldn't use this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still loving it Just wish it had more intuitive settings  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Multiple accounts I would like to backup multiple Gmail accounts  how can I do this on my android device?
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app would be batter if this feature is easy to find or available.
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately  there is no way to guarantee that the app doesn't violate your privacy and on top of that it gives google additional information about the user.
FEATURE REQUEST
It all I needed and more!
FEATURE REQUEST
When you try web login  it takes me to a page which shows ' migrate from OAuth 1.0 to OAuth 2.0.'
FEATURE REQUEST
Exactly what I needed to save the conversations that really matter!
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to backup whatsapp again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please do something I need to backup whatsapp again.
FEATURE REQUEST
I had no idea that this app would NOT allow me to back-up my stuff a 2nd time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I Had Known.
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunately  the post-installation instructions which popped up stated that the ONLY Way to get a thorough back-up  was to do the initial back-up during the setup.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing I hate is when I restored them on to my new phone the text are there but my pictures I had attached did not restore so u can see the conversation but no pictures to tell full story an I needed the text an pictures for a legal case!
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if it had an option of 1000 or 2000  because I don't need my texts from 3 years ago but more than 500 would be good.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to have my texts and call logs backed up.
FEATURE REQUEST
awesome app  works like a charm  once you install and setup you can just forget about it till you actually need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
EVERYTHING LOST Do not use I'm on LOLLYPOP I donated over 6 pounds for this application  as I was swapping phones and need some of my important texts  I backed everything up to Google using this app  I installed it on my new phone  pressed restore and it says restored 0 out of 0  I've lost everything I'm so angry.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not Reliable Enough I'm sorry  but it seems to be missing incoming text every now & then.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just now it missed 2 whereas an hour ago it successfully detected the previous 2.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love it if we could have a button to sync call logs and sms Assumed automatic backup worked.
FEATURE REQUEST
The need to improve reliability.
FEATURE REQUEST
Frikkin Awesome Does what I need  when I need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
3 only because it does back them up  but I have had it just miss entire blocks of time.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no way to actually see the back up via email.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App this does what I need it to do  but wish this was available for iPhone  iPod Touch and iPad
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Gmail integration concept  but needs more work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great but it occassionally brainfarts where i need to go and manually ok it to start after a failure that it lets me know about.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs Alternatives to Gmail Great app  but I don't like putting my SMS conversations on Gmail cuz they scrape their emails for advertising purposes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great App  works very well Would be nice if you could set a date or a time frame for which to restore.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need this app Simple and it works every time (for 3 years already).
FEATURE REQUEST
---------------------------------- Surprising useful - would be good core Gmail for Android functionality.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm getting a new phone and I need my texts!
FEATURE REQUEST
low battery usage Would be good if the notification bar status count updated more regularly.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to close the app for it to update!
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs km and miles option
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app except data wipe Would be nice to be able to edit the number of steps in previous days - sometimes after reboot data gets wiped for the day
FEATURE REQUEST
One of the best  almost I have tested many pedometer apps and I really like this one  I would use it instead of Google Fit  but there is one issue  the pause button.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would never pause this and would like an option to show or hide the pause button or choose to pause from within the settings menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
File storage integration would be nice  but it's a fantastic app.
FEATURE REQUEST
But what I am missing in it is the use of gestures.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice that it supports app backup  but when testing this the backupped .apk's could not be installed!
FEATURE REQUEST
Could have had LAN Tab!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love to be able to select a directory and have the application recursively add the contents to my Google Drive (or other) via ""Share"".
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing stuff Despite other good reviews  I have been disappointed that there didn't seem to be an option to move files from one location to another on my device.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lack of OTG support That's a dealbreaker right there.
FEATURE REQUEST
I also would have liked to see cloud support for services such as Dropbox and Google drive.
FEATURE REQUEST
The audio I want to listen to is on an external device otherwise I would just use the built-in music player on my device.
FEATURE REQUEST
The best free file manager for android I wish it had otg support  and cloud integration but it is a free app  so the lack of those features can be forgiven; however  given the fact that it is open source I'm sure it's only a matter of time before these features get added.
FEATURE REQUEST
I could even use it with root access in my Tab S when no other file explorer (even ES File Explorer Pro) could.
FEATURE REQUEST
This open source file manager needs one feature- OTG support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs an Update Recently installed it and its a good app with a nice UI but it needs a bit more customization options.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still a long way to go Incredible app with lots of potential  needs to improve in areas like copying  moving files.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please provide sidebar with quick navigation  means you can slide the bar very fast and release it to the alphabet you want  like you do in contacts app.
FEATURE REQUEST
You have to fix it
FEATURE REQUEST
Plz dev  add cloud storage support  it will make this app super awesome.
FEATURE REQUEST
nice and simple it would be nice if grid view could be set as default view.
FEATURE REQUEST
Better than es file manager but it's lack of features made me switch to Solid I understand it's open source and not going to have everything under the sun but it's just missing some critical functionality for me.
FEATURE REQUEST
Other features may work but I couldn't be bothered to try them since I need a functioning smb connection.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its missing features that should be staple.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need a more usability The ui is very charming but still lack of usability like fast scrollbar  hope it will get better soon
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm missing the abillity to access the MicroSD Card using FTP.
FEATURE REQUEST
Performs OK  just keeps telling me has stopped whenever I try to open something and samba shares continually need to be refreshed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need this 1)Besides copy and delete  add 'cut' button too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only thing I can think of that is missing is the ability to add bookmarks to folders on the android home screen/descktop.
FEATURE REQUEST
USB OTG I'd just like the ability to read/write files on a usb thumb drive using my usb-c to usb-a adapter.
FEATURE REQUEST
Too bad  I used this app for a long time but I need something stable.
FEATURE REQUEST
please add favourite folder
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm not sure if this is a system issue or something that could be added to Amaze.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nothing fancy but gets the basics right I just wish it had more features like the competition.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add OTG support
FEATURE REQUEST
Does exactly what I need and isn't trying to get me to buy features I don't care about.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just needs metwork support 4* until it has network support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Image browsing need to support gesture  instead of 1 at a time.
FEATURE REQUEST
If u want to enhance txt editor  try with over 1mb novels  and replace func incliding \n. We'd better have edit/view mode switch  and coding/novel text mode switch  but is it necessary?
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple and clean but needs some polish It is a nice and fast app but the UI needs some improvements.
FEATURE REQUEST
One problem I have with it is that it truncates the names of all files and folders so if you want to know the name of a file you need to long press select it and then go to menu properties  also on selecting files I wish it showed a bar with quick shortcuts to cut  copy  paste  share etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding increase / decrease of font size to Text Editor will be useful.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you please show the total size of folders (like in solid explorer)?
FEATURE REQUEST
You could add an option for it in the settings
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing that it's missing is support for popular cloud storage.
FEATURE REQUEST
But lacks cloud support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cloud support would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
OK I needed a root explorer with otg support and cool UI.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing is FTP and SFTP support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really nice looking but crappy If this had browsing for network shares it would be better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Keep up the good work  also for backup an apk it would be nice to backup only the apk not the file structure.
FEATURE REQUEST
More tabs would be nice  cloud service support would be welcomed too.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you need a fast  small file explorer and don't really want to have anything to do with rooting  do go with this!
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple and good Android needs more apps like this.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need something now instead of ES so I'll try it again later
FEATURE REQUEST
Especially if you want open source  but a lack of network drive access makes me take a star off.
FEATURE REQUEST
Too complex It will be better to remove app manager and the full network permission
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if the APK backup function could rename files with their version number like ES File Explorer did.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app  just needs an option to view the size of /root and home.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I try to copy/paste  or cut/paste objects from one location to the other I am being told I need to choose the root folder of the resource (external MicroSD card) and give it write permissions.
FEATURE REQUEST
elegant and efficient  but there are two things I would like to see: A simple dashboard as home screen (which  IMHO  makes more sense for the Home icon) and the ability to remove  or at least redirect  default links of predefined bookmarks (images  videos.)
FEATURE REQUEST
SFTP support would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
add move to SD Card the app
FEATURE REQUEST
list item take too much space; missing info 1) Each list item is surrounded by too much empty space.
FEATURE REQUEST
List view could have been easily compressed more.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app but need improvement Not compatible with cm13 on my oneplus one.
FEATURE REQUEST
Beautiful UI  Throughput Speeds Need Improvement I have been a loyal ES File Manager fan for a long time.
FEATURE REQUEST
New feature It would be nice to add cloud storage too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Update for Android Marshmallow App needs an update for android marshmallow.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good looking file explorer that still needs a little work.
FEATURE REQUEST
The interface is nice  but there are many missing functions that I think are essential to a file manager such as cut and compress.
FEATURE REQUEST
Other than stock cm12 I need this for when I use custom roms that give me ES file manager.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you need a quick and free solution for managing files  this is the way to go.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only hope they add more features (a storage analyzer would be nice to find out what's eating up my space!)
FEATURE REQUEST
The text editor needs a search function.
FEATURE REQUEST
A more ""material-y"" icon would be nice too.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great job It's gonna be awesome if you add dual tab exploring feature like explore file manager also i had a problem with Search function when im trying to finde for e.x *.pdf the app doesn't find any match but when I'm search for pdf  it does.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good But Can Be Improved Please add copy & move window animations.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add drag&drop system!
FEATURE REQUEST
The best material file manager  but please add drag&drop system.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs support for Drive and Dropbox.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think it would be perfect if there were a share/cloud option and for it to be compatible with DiskUsage but aside from that  it's a beautiful app!
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add option to allow changing the directory location for main menu items (DCIM  download  movies  music  videos and pictures).
FEATURE REQUEST
Much room for additions The Design and interface feels exceedingly fluid but the app lacks many features.
FEATURE REQUEST
Consider adding features like System Analyser  gesture navigaton  tagging  favourites  FTP manager  trash  swipe for options etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
And suggestion  add features 'quick apply' for color.
FEATURE REQUEST
OVERALL MATERIAL DESIGN IS ALL DONE & WE NEED MORE FEATURES SO ITS CAN BE USELMFULL FOR DAUILY BASICS.BT THANKS DEV 4 DEVELOPING THIS
FEATURE REQUEST
Good work  but long way to go Right now  the fab lacks animation  storage write is available on lollipop only  the collapsible app bar needs a revamp and much more.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add feature SMB No feature for access SMB/LAN
FEATURE REQUEST
amazing app does everything I need it to and more.
FEATURE REQUEST
UI Improvements How about adding options to add new files and folders within the floating + icon.
FEATURE REQUEST
A must on any nexus device which is missing a native file manager.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make it an option?
FEATURE REQUEST
Also could you add Dropbox support?
FEATURE REQUEST
I am just missing a link to cloud storages like Dropbox or Google Drive  with which I could upload entire folders.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would also be great to have a search function in the app manager.
FEATURE REQUEST
New update (v2.0.3) really needs fixing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great UI and colour request The look is decent and super functional  BTW there's a color accent is needed ""bright yellow""
FEATURE REQUEST
Superb but lack of FTP & Cloud Storage Option.
FEATURE REQUEST
So please add them to fullfil this awasome file manager.
FEATURE REQUEST
Folders/files icons should have a square or round option.
FEATURE REQUEST
G+ should be scrapped  it has no place in any apps nor anyone hearts except G's own.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good one pls add option to turn off animation  it needlessly slows down the operation.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could use settings menu If I could choose to show my current network speeds or my network name for the home screen widget that would be awesome
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it showed WiFi signal strength in % and IP address as well
FEATURE REQUEST
Asking to buy This is telling me I have to pay because I have more than one of his dashclock extensions installed but this is the only one.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to update quicker.
FEATURE REQUEST
Meh lacks functionalities
FEATURE REQUEST
it would be nice to see the security and signal strength also not just the connection speed.
FEATURE REQUEST
there should be option to input consumed minutes in plan setting.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's perfect but need some improvements
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you people please add service tax and monthly bill option ?
FEATURE REQUEST
First of all with 60/60 billing mode it is considering a call which was not even picked up as a 60 sec call and adding it to the widget statistics.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if u could allow the user to customize the notifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app add the two call seconds in to one.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to exclude volte
FEATURE REQUEST
Perfect Gives me the information I need every time without fail.
FEATURE REQUEST
Local std call monitor needed I need this app to support local and std call log monitor.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs a easier interface specially for dual sim phones.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now tell me what settings i need to do under mode of billing or anywhere else  so that i can get correct minutes i got charged for.
FEATURE REQUEST
The widgets for calls and data have been crashing and keep needing to be restarted in nova launcher.
FEATURE REQUEST
For me this is the best application on Google play.I am using Sony xperia m and there is no way you could keep track of your usage.
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks to this app now I can use my postpaid connection freely.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very useful Great app..helps me make best use of ny postpaid plan..would be even better if there is option of excluding roaming call minutes from the counter.
FEATURE REQUEST
Even the most complex of plan can be configured with this app  similar apps dont provide much option and are useful only for some basic plan with flat rate.
FEATURE REQUEST
It really needs a payg mode so you can track spending on payg mobiles as well as pay monthly.
FEATURE REQUEST
The SIM ID option is missing in Rule sets.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could tell the app not to register any log about these two.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to remember and find where I left off.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I could go back to the previous version.
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect If it only had the ability to go back  like 10-15 seconds  so if you missed something  you could hear it again.The only way with this app  is to drag the timeline progress bar  and that isn't as convenient or precise as the short review arrow provided by Smart AudioBook Player.
FEATURE REQUEST
Solid Auto fill the library when I add things.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish the app could disable bluetooth at end of sleep timer.
FEATURE REQUEST
App is A++  just gutted by the missing feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it could actually hide folders and does what it says it can.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great for audio books as it saves your last spot but rewinds it slightly to get you back up to speed & can add manual bookmarks.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls add an option to remove lock screen book cover It would be great  if you could an add an option to deactive the big book cover on the lock screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works fine but I wish it had more features.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I skip forward it's usually to find a certain spot in the book and I would use 30 sec or more.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs access to my SD card but when I select SD Card it still shows internal storage.
FEATURE REQUEST
Beautiful but needs work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only missing Chromecast support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it would pause when you initiate a phone call.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just What I Needed I needed an app in order to listen to downloaded audio files (audio books  purchased podcast episodes & extras  etc.) I wanted the ability to save my place  add bookmarks  organize my audio files in different folders  have a player widget on my home screen  &  most importantly  change playback speed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fine but It works but I wish it had a feature to allow extsd
FEATURE REQUEST
I have to skip back 20 seconds frequently when I'm driving or running.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice It's good but still it needs a lil improvement.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cloud storage would be perfect I would love to see cloud storage support such as Google Drive.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only one feature missing I would love the function to be able to separately control the volume  and/or to normalize or boost the volume.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing increasing playback speed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Minimal  intuitive fast This app is everything you need to enjoy your audio books.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add the ability to skip forward and backwards by n seconds.
FEATURE REQUEST
The operation is great  but the performance needs more work.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it supported m4b chapters though  would be perfect.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would really like to be able to set a sleep timer on the fly without going into settings and changing it permanently.
FEATURE REQUEST
Toast would be nice to remind us.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to not trigger lastfm like podcasts.
FEATURE REQUEST
A cast option would be great
FEATURE REQUEST
So a feature to sleep after finishing a chapter (reach the end of an mp3 file) would be very very nice to have!
FEATURE REQUEST
...lacks cloud storage support.
FEATURE REQUEST
please add ""sleep until current episode ends"" in the timer
FEATURE REQUEST
Actually I think it should be part of OS.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs update for marathi and hindi language Well it's the best clipboard app on Android but it has to be updated.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to be able to add a title for a stared clip.
FEATURE REQUEST
I use copy and paste on all of my devices  all Android of course  and it was always a bit of a pain especially when I needed multiple items copied.
FEATURE REQUEST
The pin is not required it bypass pin input menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also it would be great to dismiss the floating notification with one tap  two taps or long press.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please  add cloud sync for syncing with desktop
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there's a better way to view because I copy long scripts and it's not so comfy to read with this design
FEATURE REQUEST
Backup needs improvement Backup of clipboard are to encrypted like as ""andclip"" and importing merge all Copied items as a single item and it could be cleared as separate
FEATURE REQUEST
Love that application so much I think you should make sync for copies in any service like Google.
FEATURE REQUEST
excellent it very neat and useful its pop up when you need it
FEATURE REQUEST
Just open the app when you need it!
FEATURE REQUEST
It helps me with being organized with everything I need to have my own copies of what I'm working on.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cloud storage Plz add cloud storage feature so i can access the same clipboard on all my devices
FEATURE REQUEST
I like it but I wish it had categories and organize support plus clip sorting based on use date or use frequency.
FEATURE REQUEST
Imo the one HUGE thing this application is missing imo RIGHT NOW in its CURRENT version  is the ability to sync its data with an online source of our choosing  ie google  onedrive  Dropbox  etc.The only other thing I would LOVE to see get added is the ability to have lists of specific contents per this app  for people like me that use this as a GTD app sorting of clip ideas is desired!
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good app but need to add web search for clip board feature just like multi clip board.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good work Some bugs are still there it adds the script of copy text for example if I copy the text ""my name is KING BRANDON "" in 2 lines with hitting enter in anywhere in the text so after copy it add tag in changed line position !!!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Update app needs a update I think :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Looks good  but is confusing I just needed it to copy several ""joke"" lines  and I couldn't get it to do that without difficulty.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just started using this but so far the only missing feature is being able to categorize starred clips by folders or tag like andclip.
FEATURE REQUEST
love it but can you make window draw over keyboard?
FEATURE REQUEST
Wonderful app All I'm missing is a ""clear all"" button; maybe on notification  or floating window?
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app Please add a windows application to sync with desktop.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be really great if i could sync between devices with your apps!
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome app would love some improvements I love the app I wish that in the upper right hand corner where you can choose cancel delete I wish you could also hit Save in that location
FEATURE REQUEST
Very intuitive  well designed app No tutorial is even necessary.
FEATURE REQUEST
Had no idea how much I would actually be using it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the developer would not ask Accessibility permission for the floating bubble.
FEATURE REQUEST
good i like it   but need more updates and features
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish Native Clipboard and Clip Stack could have a baby together to become the best clipboard manager as they both have advantages over the other.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would have been nice to include a brief tutorial in the initial starred clips present after installing the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
hey  could you please speak twice as fast so I don't even have to try understanding a single word ?
FEATURE REQUEST
On top of what's already pretty great I'd suggest adding a settings option to change how many show up in history in the notification  also a button to collapse the notification.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing that is missing is the ability to add folders.
FEATURE REQUEST
Bro you are great You have done a wonderful job but If you add editing option on floating window that would be good
FEATURE REQUEST
(I give Google Play Store itself a current rating of 3 based on this amongst other faults  such as not allowing me to rate and review IT even though it is an app itself) My testing and review time May be cut short due to a "" Real"" Beta Test starting soon
FEATURE REQUEST
Clipstack can't do anything about it and that's fine but I wish there was a toggle in the notification so I can easily turn it on and off  still being able to copy text from it though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very useful app I wish I knew about this app much earlier  could save me lots of time.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it wouldn't copy text from my password manager app KeePassDroid(or could a blocked list be enabled somehow so it wouldn't show every time I copy my password?)
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing that should be noted is the fact that certain password manager like ""safe in cloud"" use a copy and paste method to fill password fields and there is no way (at all?)
FEATURE REQUEST
Man I need something something like this on pc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you make chrome extension ?
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app needs work
FEATURE REQUEST
Please make it able to discard that particular clipping so I do not need to save all my clippings.
FEATURE REQUEST
OMG yess This is awesome you can use it to backup bookmarks without taking up space on your phone
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Please add category or folder options then it will be perfect
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it was an all-in-one app
FEATURE REQUEST
..also a delete history would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
No autofill Would be nice if clicking a clip will auto fill it into the selected textbox
FEATURE REQUEST
I really love this app its exactlly what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Useful However  it still needs some basic features  such as: (1) a filter or separate list to show only the starred (favourite) entries  and (2) a way to change their sort order e.g. Alphabetical or reverse chronological  plus (3) one button exporting ALL captured entries to a text file (currently you have to select them one by one or set a time period).
FEATURE REQUEST
I had been using Copy Bubble but found it lacking a few features.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nuts Only way i could uninstall was from the play store.
FEATURE REQUEST
Man i love this...i ll be damn if you guys add feature like pushbullet..sync copied stuff all over device.
FEATURE REQUEST
Floating button Can add ""paste"" shortcut on floating window?
FEATURE REQUEST
I would rate it 5*s if we could have the notification icon to be green and white as the opening icon is and not black and white.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app When I open the notification  and then remove all the items in the clip stack  it'd be cool to just automatically close out of the activity.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add black/dark theme
FEATURE REQUEST
When I tried to connect my bluetooth earbuds it would not connect.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need this app perfect ;)
FEATURE REQUEST
A very good compitator for clipper that has few more features but lacking the floating window feaure of clip stack.
FEATURE REQUEST
Even more awesome is that floating bubble opens when you need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for adding the floating window.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please consider adding shadow to the icon
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to read em down the page.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be an easy option to start and stop the listening service right away in the notification panel
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app but of no use App only creates a list of copied text  which can be used later  there should be an feature so that user can copy multiple text at once and the app merges them in one with newline character between them  so that we can send multiple copied txt at once to one person and don't have to go to the app to copy it again and again
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like a blacklist option though  so I can remove password managers etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls add cross device support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Easy Way i was too much harder to send all contacts one by one message.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really cool msging app but it needs to have some changes on interface
FEATURE REQUEST
I would suggest improving the visual impression and adding more tweaks in the configuration settings like timed batch sending.
FEATURE REQUEST
Root shell missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great idea in case you are out of network range and need to communicate in the near range.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great idea  overcome the problems  world need free Internet
FEATURE REQUEST
Im inpressed I know that the phone has to be rooted in order to use the ad hoc connection but it is still very impressive and I would like to see it continue to improve   keep up the good work  a good improvement would be the ability to use the phones radio to use other phones radios to communicate sort of as a Mobile cell tower so that you can send messages through a whole bunch of other phones to get to one phone assuming the phone can reach.
FEATURE REQUEST
If this could be overcome this would deploy rapidly.
FEATURE REQUEST
I've really no way to tell if this app is working.
FEATURE REQUEST
I gave it 5 star....bcoz i know about mesh networking....i have not used the app yet....but i take guarantee that it will run well.....thnx developer...the future of communication is here...i would suggest you to improve its ui...size is nt been the issue.:-)(can i get source code plz?!)
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  better the Firechat This is the best app to get for emergencies or for use anytime when you need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Not impressed Needs internet access to run.
FEATURE REQUEST
We need more apps like this
FEATURE REQUEST
You need this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great concept need more people participating and mesh extended to the world.
FEATURE REQUEST
Too many permissions required I had to uninstall after I saw the permission requirements that I think were not necessary for the operation of this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
No need to search for on/off button.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great while I needed it.
FEATURE REQUEST
A very simple app that does exactly what you need it to do with no extra frills.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple and efective -small in size  the lowest footprint compared to similar apps  probably just the code needed to run it and start the flash.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple and best Its just around 30 KB and does the job  or what else do we need a torch for.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only what you need!
FEATURE REQUEST
Must have All should have this.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it would be great if it kept the screen from turning itself off.
FEATURE REQUEST
If the torch respond faster would be cool!
FEATURE REQUEST
The reason you need root (also called superuser) is because the Hosts file is a SYSTEM file  so only root can modify it (sorta like when you open/run something  i.e. CMD as administrator on Windows).
FEATURE REQUEST
If you don't know what root is  just don't do anything that needs root.
FEATURE REQUEST

Almost good Wod be nice and good  but all the pictures  banners  photos etc are missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be even better if you can add one more feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add ""missed episodes"" to history tab  so we can manually search for it if sickrage misses it for whatever reason.
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for adding option to disable version checking.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing a sort feature in the shows section  like running/not running.
FEATURE REQUEST
One thing is when adding a show you can't choose to want only future episodes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Post process It'd be nice to select directories for post processing on the fly.
FEATURE REQUEST
Manual post processing would be great!
FEATURE REQUEST
That would be great in an otherwise perfect app!
FEATURE REQUEST
There should be a option to save and open the games from the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Opening Book move names with variation need to be shown in the movelist area.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is best Chess engine ever  but I think it should be able for chess engine to read files of .
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent application Please add opening book tree view same as deep fritz and need more arrows to see opening book hints...then this will become greatest android application forever.
FEATURE REQUEST
engine vs engine & second per moves is missing.

Would be cool to analyze chess 960 as well !?
FEATURE REQUEST
move per second time controls and engine vs engine is missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome Chess App This is an awesome chess app  but I would like to see a feature where you could have two different chess engines go against each other.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also an option for infinite time would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to see this feature in next update.

Beeeeeeeest and evry tinks u need Uzer freandly.

FEATURE REQUEST
Shut down option needed Shut down option needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best chess app on Android Sir can u add chess960 option to it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but lacking customisable time control Great app but would be a lot better if it was possible to adjust clock for one side.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if it was introduced.
FEATURE REQUEST
Although there are some features that could be implemented in the future  the app is great as it is right now.
FEATURE REQUEST
The fact is I can use the same UCI engine (Stockfish) both for DroidFish and for Chess PGN Viewer.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a way to connect via Bluetooth to make a match between devices like stockfish vs stockfish just to know which device has better CPU ram and to see how it comes up in practical uses like a chess match.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if the blindfold mode could be accesed from a button outside the settings menu.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need update This was the best chess apps but now it needs update to keep the position. "
FEATURE REQUEST
"Analyze this"" is more enjoyable to play although lacking some features droid fish has.
FEATURE REQUEST
It now become a must that droid fish need feature of engine match and kibitz.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app lacks media card access even so very good
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to see the ability to run engine vs engine matches instead of just computer vs computer
FEATURE REQUEST
Droidfish is not complete without those missing functions.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to free lots of memory on my tablet.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Good and easy to use....and very strong...very useful...but update version missing CPU core threads
FEATURE REQUEST
Option missing Option button for staring new game is missing after update.
FEATURE REQUEST
Thank you for adding the option pgn player which i suggested.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nothing beats it I don't know  I strongly believe that there is no way you can build a better chess app or any app for that matter.
FEATURE REQUEST
Poor game Need improvement
FEATURE REQUEST
Broken and no response from developer This app would be great but I can no longer access any settings because the developer hasn't built any interface other than your phone having a menu key into the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm only missing a chess 960 option and the option to play online.
FEATURE REQUEST
Autoplay and Blunder Check needed Dear Peter Osterlund  Thanks for your inclusion of autoplay option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Now I just need to find a perfect chess puzzle app
FEATURE REQUEST
Stockfish with a playing strength over 3000 elo  you can use to visually show it's thinking lines.
FEATURE REQUEST
Strongest app for free that you can get out there.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app does not make you miss ios paid chess apps at all.
FEATURE REQUEST
Although you can add more unessential features such as kibitzer etc. (a la Chessbase)  what makes the Droidfish highly efficient is that the developer has thoughtfully chosen the most productive features for a mobile implementation.
FEATURE REQUEST
The devs would be better off serving humanity by working at a mcdonalds.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you maybe add the old UI as an option?
FEATURE REQUEST
I enjoy tor on my computer I can use it on my computer but on my andriod the Internet is too slow to even use I'm pretty sure I did everything to improve the Internet access but even on WiFi it doesn't even give me 5kbps so I see why I should have it on my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Miss the style of the old apk
FEATURE REQUEST
Let say my temporal internet suplier has blocked all torrent sites  so with this one will i be able to visit them again?
FEATURE REQUEST
v1.5.2.0-RC8 series VPN mode overall  the new VPN mode in beta & RC v1.5.2.0 is a GOOD THING.
FEATURE REQUEST
it would be even better if the app inclusion/exclusion list actually worked.
FEATURE REQUEST
that forces disabling VPN mode  entirely  to allow apps that need orbot exclusions to work properly.
FEATURE REQUEST
Better and better New interface is nice  easier to use  online Wiki Help would be nice and a way to teach the fundamentals of Internet security to the masses.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome :) Much needed improvements!
FEATURE REQUEST
Bridges don't work and the app needs to be force-stopped sometimes to refresh the connection.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works fine after deleting and reinstalling app Need to reinstall app in case it's freezing or not connecting.
FEATURE REQUEST
In my first year of bachelors in IT  hopefully I'll be able to give back also.
FEATURE REQUEST
This should be highlighted in the app's description  since it's not very apparent to many users  and they might give Orbot a bad rating for something that isn't its fault.
FEATURE REQUEST
Privacy made easy Offers the best privacy I need specially suggested to individuals who need privacy
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it could work with devices without root access as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Use to love this program but this needs to be addressed
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome App Needs to get an update for users using Custom ROM.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to incorporate some feature that disguises the fact that you are using Tor - now that laws have changed.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can use TOR on my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish people would realise WHY the Tor network is so slow  instead of complaining straight away.
FEATURE REQUEST
After switching the service off  one needs to flush all proxy (last option in settings) to be able to use the Internet again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only reboot can solve the problem.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good Although the VPN speed should be optimised.
FEATURE REQUEST
Slow as hell Browsing with tor network is very slow it takes too much time to open a page needs lots of patience
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Love it  please add new zealand server !

Battery Killer I hate to uninstal it but I had to simply because it's depleting my battery power .

FEATURE REQUEST
Finally it got so bad I had to reboot several times until regular Internet worked again   then uninstall it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Why It was working fine now out shuts down when I try to turn it on
FEATURE REQUEST
Whenever I use the built in vpn option it slows down everything data-based to a point where I may as well not use it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Perhaps I'm sad and lonely  but this needs to be looked at.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's good for those who does have knowledge of network a bit  amateur like myself is very difficult getting it worked  the vpn never connects to internet  I think u guys should give some guidance how to get it worked.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cnnect disconnect Loosrs connection must be shut down and restarted.

Good Working ok VeryGood overall.One slight issue  when I select world   all I see is a blank white space  I assume there should be a list of countries there  I can touch on the space- it does change at the bottom ok but its random since I cant see any countries in the space to make an accurate selection.S4 running 4.4.2 .
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if it wouldn't turn on automatically when the device turns on so I would have to constantly turn it off when I don't need tor.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app and vpn as well I love this app  its just missing Mexico for vpn  because I would like to watch Netflix in Spanish
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to bypass the firewall!
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
Everyone needs this nowadays.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to update the disconnected notification.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need this if you are using DuckDuckGo search engine.
FEATURE REQUEST
Personally  I would really like the ability to chose certain counties to avoid routing traffic through if it were possible.
FEATURE REQUEST
App Proxy Keeps Crashing It I love this app  and it's the only one I use for the TOR network  but it would be great if you could fix the bugs with the app Proxy button on the bottom in the middle.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd really like to be able to use it
FEATURE REQUEST
Pleased Wish it could load faster but other then that that's algoods
FEATURE REQUEST
When I try to go to an address it hangs around quarter of the way in.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish that the more n more +ve use of deep internet instead of jst being darknet.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing it
FEATURE REQUEST
Yeah its ok but there should be more planets
FEATURE REQUEST

FEATURE REQUEST
Cool view and nice move's  I think everyone needs to try it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can choose many background that goes behind the planets and add many star the speed it awesome
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Should have more apps like this.
FEATURE REQUEST
AWESOME It has so many options I think everyone should have it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Droid owners need to get a better phone!
FEATURE REQUEST
Cool It is very cool...but something Missing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would have been ok if not for all the ad's interrupting me trying to change the settings.
FEATURE REQUEST
When i tried to set the paper  my background home screen just went white then black.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only wish it had the earth in the background.
FEATURE REQUEST
Aww Wish I cud get this to work but all the writing appears as blocks so I don't know what's what.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs more I want to see where i am on earth but not be on my gps and also be able to see the clouds on the earth
FEATURE REQUEST
Textures and distance The moon needs to be alot further and there needs to be mountains  clouds  and past earth globes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it Go to the setting and play around with it for a few minutes and figure out all the stuff you can do  I also love how there's so many planets my favorite is 'The Globetroter Home World' my only probelm is I wish I could change the back ground to some cool nebulas or galaxys or somthing but thats no big deal 5?
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent wallpaper wish I could share it on Facebook !
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add a background of half the sun that moves.
FEATURE REQUEST
Glad I can use this wallpaper again.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs a bug fix.
FEATURE REQUEST
My phone freezed fir about 10 mins..thought it's better to delete this stupid fake wallpaper  which may harm my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Scaling broken Today's update broke the scaling down to height/width  now I need to move the image up/down  left/right to see all  otherwise a great reader.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks Pinch Zoom Seriously  it has no glitches but that's the one flaw it has: you have to change zoom through the settings.
FEATURE REQUEST
Delete function would be cool as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls add zoom function
FEATURE REQUEST
It's nice Can't zoom (need to use settings) and everytime I go to the end of a page it goes to the next page.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing but needs fixing The app is amazing but after the last update  the app don't open comics anymore and closes itself.
FEATURE REQUEST
Clean  but missing important features Overall I like the clean UI but it is missing some important features like zooming and some basic library functionality.
FEATURE REQUEST
Might need to look for a better comic reader.
FEATURE REQUEST
Has potential Touch sensitivity is awful  lack of options  no zoom.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pinch for zoom and support for pdf files would be very nice to add.
FEATURE REQUEST
Certainly  given its small size and ease of use i must say its one of the most bestest apps out there and i will surely give it a five star rating if u add a pinch zoom feature in it!
FEATURE REQUEST
this is really good i just wish there was a way to mark stuff as read.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really think you need to start with more than a single  solitary hp to make people want to keep trying better themselves.
FEATURE REQUEST
We should be able to pick up and put down whenever!
FEATURE REQUEST
If you improve bookmarks and create a tab for favorites/bookmarks  that would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Morever  no need to have internet access.
FEATURE REQUEST
Volunteers came from all over need to communicate and this has helped  especially good that internet access is not necessary.
FEATURE REQUEST
Seldom is it lacking an English word that I am seeking.
FEATURE REQUEST
I find that it's missing a lot of basic stuff even though it has more words.
FEATURE REQUEST
useful please add option to update database per dic.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app should be redesigned following material design guidelines  but it's a must have anyway!
FEATURE REQUEST
One of the best Please add share function
FEATURE REQUEST
Surprised Really very impressive app.just need to update the live timing status
FEATURE REQUEST
update please make clock run and add transparent bar
FEATURE REQUEST
Bad Time should be run
FEATURE REQUEST
It's good but Need some changes the time should update automatically!
FEATURE REQUEST
Very helpful I used to do image editing to clean up the status bar in my screenshots before I publish to the store  now I can just use this cool app to save my time.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see the f-ing time.
FEATURE REQUEST
We need tools like this.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Need to be improve more.
FEATURE REQUEST
loved it very nice  add more .
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app Good application to hide sys bar  please update time with system time  else anyone can find it's a fake...also add more icons like  alarm etc to look like feel real sys bar.
FEATURE REQUEST
One Request Can you made same app for navigation bar?
FEATURE REQUEST
Not showing real At least clock have to show correct time so no one can say that its fack notification bar.
FEATURE REQUEST
proves it can be done  but lacks features i would think essential for 'developers'.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to see the full date including year and timezone  and the clock should at least pick up the current date/time in the settings screen  and would be nice if it would run  optionally with/without some offset.
FEATURE REQUEST
Make it work You had the right idea by hiding the notifications now all you need to do is make it work make the clock run make the battery the right percentage and make it so you can choose which notifications you want and this app will be perfect!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  very useful Would love to see an option to customize the battery percentage
FEATURE REQUEST
Nah... It would be cool if it was a live status bar.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome I Love It More Than Another App But What's Missing Is Just Notification Panel  I'll Rate 5 Stars If You Did :D ;) !!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good Can you please add iOS and Windows Phone status bar and for a 4.5 inch screen those icons are to big please make them smaller.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add battery percentage.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's great for what it's supposed to do but it would be great of the developer made a second app that was real time.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to add clear everytime i pull down notifications the status bar cuts it off this doesnt mean give it opacity then we wouldnt be able to see the icons on status bar
FEATURE REQUEST
It also cleans status bar even without need for setting a specific color  but it lacks customization.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is amazing  the best part is the fact that plugins can add new sources.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if there's a widget to change the wallpaper manually
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see an option to have grayscale only on the homescreen or the lockscreen as well as be able to customize the Android Wear watch face!
FEATURE REQUEST
However there should be a gesture you can do on the homescreen to change the wallpaper so you dont have to go back into the app to do that.
FEATURE REQUEST
Minor problems You should be able to set an hour for the wallpaper to change.
FEATURE REQUEST
No widget Just add a widget for quick wallpaper change
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing I only wish that it could be blurred on lock screen but clear once unlocked without having to tap the screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Android wear Please add analog mode and date feature in the watchface.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see the addition of a widget which can simulate from the home screen the ""Next Wallpaper"" that is found inside the app without opening the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app But watch face needs better design.
FEATURE REQUEST
I still wish we could have options for more plugins.
FEATURE REQUEST
it should have been centered
FEATURE REQUEST
Good idea but missing some features When it works it works very good but when it doesn't it's frustrating.
FEATURE REQUEST
For some reason the wallpaper won't refresh for me when I click on the double arrows to change to a new wallpaper  there is no way of favourating images so that they would repeat in the future or downloading them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good I wish there was a way to access my Google photos as a source without an extension.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sometimes the focus of the picture isn't dead centre  it'd be nice to centre it myself.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks png functionality A black bar appears over the bottom portion of png images when they are unblurred (in their original form).
FEATURE REQUEST
I'll have to switch to another wallpaper app if this one isn't going anywhere.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls add only lockscreen wallpaper support Cannot set wallpaper on lockscreen individually.I have to set wallpaper for both home screen as well as lockscreen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add a feature through which we can set wallpaper only on lockscreen
FEATURE REQUEST
Previously: Love this app  but we seriously need multiselect for adding our own photos from the gallery.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice App but still lacking Needs the ability to save artworks  if not  at least the ability to choose what artwork you want or when the intervals are for the next painting.
FEATURE REQUEST
Its alright The app is ok I would suggest adding album covers when music is playing by default and not as an extension
FEATURE REQUEST
I also wish there was a finer control on the blurring  there's quite a big step between not blurred and the smallest amount of blurring you can get.
FEATURE REQUEST
misses the vital feature this would be a 5 star rating if it had the one feature i need it for  displaying a custom background (in my case music extension) on the lock screen  but not elsewhere.
FEATURE REQUEST
- Would love the option of sorting the subreddit by 'top' 'hot' and 'new' (all time  past week..etc.) (reddit extension) - Being able to blur the screen when you want (double tapping background) should also be an option as opposed to the always blury unless you tap (and even then  it stays clear for a few seconds and goes back to blur).
FEATURE REQUEST
What I suggest is having more control over the blur option.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs a way to skip paintings Loved this app but had to uninstall as I didn't like a painting in particular and there is no way to skip a painting.
FEATURE REQUEST
I dont get it Needs looong time load next picture if at all.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if we had an option to un blur it on the home or lock screen!
FEATURE REQUEST
It is a great app but it could be better if I could choose which photos folder will go random for wallpaper
FEATURE REQUEST
Hi Roman  could you please  please  pretty please add option to only apply blur on the image while the lockscreen is on  and none when the device is unlocked?
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish out wasn't all fuzzy I know it's to be less distracting but I wish there was a setting option to make it not blurry.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish they added a widget for a quick wallpaper change.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best app for art lovers Can u also please add indian exotic art?
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to activate it again and again.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can't risk encountering this bug again so unfortunately I'll need to uninstall this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had more works from the Americas and Asia.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  but needs to update Option to disable pleaee
FEATURE REQUEST
4 stars based on lack of customization on watch face.
FEATURE REQUEST
I feel like I have seen all the art before in college and at museums  wish it were a little more invigorating.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to always be in memory  so really not ideal.
FEATURE REQUEST
I am wondering if the dev could add a setting to decide if the wallpaper chosen can be shown in full rather than the zoom currently.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs to work offline with ""Backdrops"" app
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but needs more settings It's a beautiful wallpaper app with much extensibility but little customisability.
FEATURE REQUEST
Instead of adding every picture 1 by 1.
FEATURE REQUEST
Four thumbs up Can developers add downloading feature to the plugin.
FEATURE REQUEST
Works well The ability to save some of the wall papers would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be quite useful.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty perfect Only thing that I'm missing is the possibility to change the gesture to display the wallpaper (not only double tap  that generally turn off display on some devices).
FEATURE REQUEST
If Musei could allow other gestures (three taps  two finger tap  etc) to be used  it would be useful to folks like me again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good app  could use much needed improvements Good app  does the job.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pls Add manual wallpaper switch when using photos on device.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Great app even syncs with my comic reader app and sets the wallpaper to my android where watch which is a nice feature however the ability to add widgets on Android where would be nice and potentially the option to adjust when the wallpaper changes throughout the day and how often
FEATURE REQUEST
As I expected Please add some functions like triple tap to change wallpaper  parallax effect.
FEATURE REQUEST
Seems to be missing an important feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Great app that uses little battery interface could be slightly better for adding new sources however it has a smooth menu the Android where is great with no crashes and low battery use however the ability to add widgets to the watch face would be nice
FEATURE REQUEST
No auto update of wallpapers Loved this app with the bing wallpapers add on but now on my nexus 6p the wallpapers do not update automatically.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'm sure it would be great  if.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you update the app so it so it uses less battery life it would be much better
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great It would be nice if the larger images would scroll left and right with the swipe to move the desktop so you can see the whole image.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is what you need!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
I had to load the app twice before it pulled another one (edit: then 5 mins later it reverted to the first wallpaper).
FEATURE REQUEST
AWESOME APP hello developer i do want to say that this app is great  but can you add the option of a pharallex effect to the wallpaper  that would make it perfect :) !!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Widget Suggestion It would be nice to have a small widget with the following buttons.
FEATURE REQUEST
Watch face Would be nice to have some more options for the accompanying watch face  but otherwise a solid app!
FEATURE REQUEST
Once I got the WP I like  there is no way to keep it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Too few customizations What it needs is a setting that allows you to set a specific time cycle when to automatically change wallpaper.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can only use it with a third party launcher.
FEATURE REQUEST
As much as I love seeing just the left part of backgrounds  I just have this feeling I'm missing half the picture.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing Something?
FEATURE REQUEST
Feature request I think it would be great if you add an option to control the time when the photo become blurry ( sorry if my English is bad )
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app but some bugs I guess Whenever I restart my phone the doesn't load my photos need to select them again.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no previous wallpaper option which is annoying This app should have that option it's such a basic thing
FEATURE REQUEST
This would be cool If it were possible  could there be an option so when you double tap the apps go out of focus  to give it a great foreground  background effect.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Should add more gestures to view the background unblurred since double tap locks the screen on some phones
FEATURE REQUEST
Font Great app  only issue i have i wish you could have the text center of the watch and also options to change the font style
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way to get it working again is to restart my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
S6 Edge crash S6 Edge crash every time when I add custom images from gallery
FEATURE REQUEST
This is very strange: why does a wallpaper app need to run continuously in the bavkgrt and consume so much memory
FEATURE REQUEST
I only have one homepage page so it would be great if Muzei could do some sort of auto scroll.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love a pause button I love this app and seeing different gorgeous pictures every day  but sometimes there are ones I wish I could keep a little longer.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be so much better if I did not have to open the app to see it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if you could set unblurred as the default state  and only blur on touch when necessary.
FEATURE REQUEST
More fine-grain controls for the lock screen would also be good.
FEATURE REQUEST
Permanently Focused I completely understand the decision to blur the background to contrast app icons  but an option to keep the background focused would also be great  and make this app a five star one.
FEATURE REQUEST
You should add a parallax feature I think the background would look better if you had a parallax option like on iOS devices.
FEATURE REQUEST
I absolutely love this app  but adding the ability to choose the section of an image to set as wallpaper would be great  especially if the image has wide aspect ratio.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if I could double tap my screen to see my pictures that I set from my gallary.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be better if there's an option for blur effect on Lockscreen only!
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add more art App is great  but I think it started to show old pictures sometimes  wish I could see new every day
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see my wallpaper without a blank bottom and blur.
FEATURE REQUEST
Is there a way to skip an artwork?
FEATURE REQUEST
Great I only wish there was an option for permanent notification with artist.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing wallpaper  watch face could use an analog setting.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it would center align or at last give the option.
FEATURE REQUEST
I like the idea of this app but i wish they made a button to unblur the pictures.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent Works excellent  would like to be able to select several sources at once and a random wallpaper picked from them but it's easy to change .
FEATURE REQUEST
Google Now Launcher If it worked properly with the Google Now Launcher  I would absolutely use this app
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a way to like images so they were more likely to appear in the future.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to be able to filter by resolution or orientation.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need a different font  the option to use the system font  or a set of font options.
FEATURE REQUEST
For example  I wish I could change the font or use an analog face.
FEATURE REQUEST
Additionally  there is no way to change the wallpaper change interval for the watch  and the wallpaper doesn't always refresh making it quite confusing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent With New Resources Options it's getting really good.Thanks for The App.Please keep adding new features.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it Having a link to click on to learn about a painting you like would be a nice
FEATURE REQUEST
Very nice I'd like to be able to have unblurred images for the wallpaper  but the app is still very good.
FEATURE REQUEST
And second  it would be nice if you could link the app to a folder so that everything in the folder would be you backgrounds instead of having to add them individually.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you link it with Google art project instead of wiki art?
FEATURE REQUEST
All need to grow up and work together to fix this issue.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way around this is to use the G+ extension and select an album.
FEATURE REQUEST
Beautiful App To see the artwork one can double tap the background; however  this feature could be reserved by some launchers/skins already.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to be able to save my favorite daily art to a favorites gallery of some sort and use that as an alternate source.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love to be able to set it on a daily or even weekly refresh rate!
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd really like the option to have whatever wallpaper centered by default.
FEATURE REQUEST
But I wish I can browser wallpaper history and save or share them.
FEATURE REQUEST
The time to change backgrounds should have the option of 30 minutes as the minimum.
FEATURE REQUEST
More customisation options would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Request Please add option for selecting a directory as pictures.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs a date on watch face
FEATURE REQUEST
Folders Instead of Photos Really great  but it'd be even better if in My Photos we could choose entire folders instead of individual photos.
FEATURE REQUEST
If it was only landscape artwork being featured or there was some way we could choose which art to use as the background through the archives instead it would be five stars as well .
FEATURE REQUEST
Suggestions for improvement: Slight motion of wallpaper like iphones do would be cool.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also ability to use muzei lock screen with Samsung lock screen effect would be great!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was a setting to filter out non-HD images though
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to remove the double-tap feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
really nice app just needs ability to disable auto updates
FEATURE REQUEST
Just one problem; isn't there a way to save the artwork?
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it would work on my S6 5 star if it actually worked like it should.
FEATURE REQUEST
my s4 was cool because you could double tap anywhere on the bkrd and it would show you the actual art.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could choose multiple sources.
FEATURE REQUEST
Which gives me strange wallpaper every time I turn wifi on  this is good  though occasionally inapropriate :) The only problem I have with it  is that the same wallpaper is often repeated if you try to force update the wallpaper  to get past some NSFW material that occasionally pops up.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would love to rate this higher  but.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Plus add the ability to select a folder directly.
FEATURE REQUEST
CyanogenMod 12 Problem I like this app and would love to use it  but for some reason it keeps crashing.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to double tap it always to see..any alternative to this so that I can see the pictures cleanly
FEATURE REQUEST
That app has it's own functionality to change wallpapers automatically but it misses the blur/double tap option.
FEATURE REQUEST
If it needs to be done on the end of Tapet  perhaps you could reach out?
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the app could be optimized to use less than that.
FEATURE REQUEST
It will be better if you can add auto changing wallpaper and animation such as zooming and moving.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I needed this in my life.
FEATURE REQUEST
But It would be great if it would work with my lock screen also.
FEATURE REQUEST
Takes too much RAM Idea is great but needs to updated more frequently.
FEATURE REQUEST
everyone should use this app (too many people use horrible and text-unfriendly wallpapers)
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a way to make the app so that i can make the background focuse with only one tap on a certain spot or whatever because the app is nearly useless now.
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect Please add option to toggle double tap on home screen for full reveal.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really cool Love the app  but it would be nice to have some info about each painting  about the artist  movement  themes  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Caveats: I wish it would do a better job of centering and scaling local images to fit the number of home screens I have and the resolution of my device.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would also be nice if I could permanently download images to my device  so that over time I could fill up a folder of favorites to draw from with the My Photos source.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks simplicity I cannot add a whole folder at one  and still  I selected 500 wallpapers to add  and when I tapped add it didn't add anything.
FEATURE REQUEST
Ok Had to change rating But why the hell would you guys have the default settings blurry ridiculous in my opinion a lot of people are going to poorly rate because they think it's blurry and not everyone has the intelligence to find the setting to fix that got to remember there's a lot more stupid people than there is smart ones.
FEATURE REQUEST
Only wish I could adjust the panning and cropping of images.
FEATURE REQUEST
I use the Bing add on.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish I could set a minimum resolution or preferred resolution though
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice It would be better if the link also tells us the story behind/around the artwork rather than just techical specifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great However  I would like ability to make a custom time for how often the photos change.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it had a 12hr option for switching the wallpaper (I have a day/night shot I want to use)
FEATURE REQUEST
I would appreciate if it add landscape and other ""sources"" options in the same app  but still works nice!
FEATURE REQUEST
I didnt know how much I needed this I am irrationally excited to see what my desktop will change to next!
FEATURE REQUEST
Only suggestion is perhaps you could offer art for the lockscreen as well?
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but needs more option on changing the wallpaper I think this app needs to have either more times to change the wall paper e.g. every 12 hours or to allow the user to custom come up with a time to change the wallpaper.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish I could change the photo at a set time each day
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty good - just 1 problem Just needs the ability to crop and adjust the pictures.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also would like to be able to change scaling.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to have some other options for bringing the image into focus.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does it have to be blurred Am I missing something or would the wallpaper be always blurred ?
FEATURE REQUEST
But  I wish you could create multiple folders for sets of wallpapers.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lastly it would be nice if you could add an option to assign one wallpaper to a timeslot.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome I love this app  but would love to see more options in the Android Wear watch face.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love having the art as background  but really miss having the date  watch charge  weather  or any other info displayed.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would give it 5 stars but when I am adding my own wallpaper I have to add theme one by one and it would be nice to have a multiple select feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
crash all the time it would be better if you could pass a n artwork you don't like
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty good Changes wallpapers way to little every 5 or even 1 minutes would be amazing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app  could add more features Great app for making wallpapers and great selection of live wallpapers.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would have been great if it had a next wallpaper widget!
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing the Obvs - No More It seems odd the one would want quality Art Blurred in a background App.
FEATURE REQUEST
But It would be nice if the back ground moved along with side swiping the home screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish that  when I select the music source  it would stay that way after sitting idly for a while.
FEATURE REQUEST
**UPDATE** I have been informed that there are additional modules/apps with a variety of photos which can be added!
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs parallax Great LWP  but needs parallax support.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you add that 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
but wish there was a way to pause it on a certain wall indefinitely.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love Muzei but I wish the font was up higher and used light instead of regular or bold font.
FEATURE REQUEST
Completely oblitarated my wallpaper woes Now  to make it perfect  we just need an action to Favorite the best of the best wallpapers  so we can curate our own selection and revisit them whenever we feel like.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some suggestions I'd like the ability to apply the dim on the lock screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also as others have said  I'd like more options for Android Wear when it comes to watch faces.
FEATURE REQUEST
It is a hard crash where the app must be relaunched and the phone restarted for it to run again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs the option for analog This watch face is great and all  but it definitely needs to have the option of analog.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would sure be nice to be able to go back  look up the artist in question  save and reuse favorite backgrounds  send them to friends.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love an option to center the pictures on my homescreen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Perhaps you could add this as a pay feature and offer cloud backup?
FEATURE REQUEST
If it's at all possible it would be cool for Muzei to work with Tapet as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Displays my Flickr photostream with an add-on Would like to be able to disable the zoomed in view and just have it display the photo as-is.
FEATURE REQUEST
I only wish I could save images and choose what part of picture should be set as wallpaper.
FEATURE REQUEST
Improvement suggest -to be able to select the part of the image that you want as a wallpaper.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding Multiple image in 1 go is missing It takes a lot of time if i need to add many images.
FEATURE REQUEST
The minimum interval for change should be decreased.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  but needs some more options.
FEATURE REQUEST
Beautiful and simple  but needs some more options.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see also the name of the art movement.
FEATURE REQUEST
Too blury I like the idea but we should be able to set the level of blur and brightness.
FEATURE REQUEST
would be nice to have option to turn on name and artist of painting on bottom left of wallpaper (much like its show in 'main' app preview from notification)
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but needs more settings Been crashing consistently with the Dropbox extension.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish it was running.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was option to mix wallpapers from multiple sources.
FEATURE REQUEST
It does what it does Wished i had more control on the pictures
FEATURE REQUEST
Crashes on Nexus 6 Great great app  but somehow out of nowhere it stops working after a while  and a restart is needed to run it again.
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing high res walls Please add a feature to randomize wallpapers on lock screen too
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish I could make the refresh rate every 10 minutes
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  but lacking I like it and the amount of wonderful extensions makes this pretty cool but it bothers me that as someone that doesn't use scrolling wallpapers it will often just show me the left part of the image.
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be great if you could set it so the wallpaper would move slowly in the background or you could choose which part of the picture you saw.
FEATURE REQUEST
coool need to be some wat improved.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if you could add the ability to select the entire folder whenever we wish to display pictures from my photos.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great content  but we should really have the option to choose which part of each picture fits on our screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs better android wear support Pictures look great  but android wear watch face needs to at least show the date.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it would save the images shown or have a display history.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add a 'crop to screen' option in the advanced options?
FEATURE REQUEST
you've to fix this priblem.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see more information on the watch.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish there was an option to ""favourite"" the best wallpapers.
FEATURE REQUEST
pretty but lacking Good concept.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  if you could add the ability to select all photos within an album rather than having to select them one by one  that would be great
FEATURE REQUEST
So integrated into my android experience that I feel it should be built in to Android.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacking such basic functionality docks it 2 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
I love this app but it's missing the option to switch to the previous painting if you don't like the current one.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's great but It crashes after adding about 200 photos
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the artists would change daily.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be really great if it could cache images when on WiFi so that wallpapers still cycle when not on WiFi if set to not download over cellular data.
FEATURE REQUEST
Every Android phone should have this installed.
FEATURE REQUEST
An option for wifi download only would be useful.
FEATURE REQUEST
need option it's blurred automatically  please add an option.
FEATURE REQUEST
That's all that needs to be said about it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just wish I could see all of it I love the app and the updated pictures from reddit.
FEATURE REQUEST
When the team is putting so much effort then adding a little description will not be a problem I guess.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice but There should be additional option so as to control the double tap blur effect.
FEATURE REQUEST
Juz awesome I luvd it but it would be better if we have some options
FEATURE REQUEST
Auto blurring is undesirable A provision for disabling auto blurring of wallpaper should be provided.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need more options Good concept.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish I hadn't found this app Found this app  liked the artwork.
FEATURE REQUEST
I agree with another reviewer that it would be nice if I could specify the centering when choosing my own images  but that's a small thing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs little more option It needs option to change the painting manually when you don't like it  rather than wait for a day until it change automatically
FEATURE REQUEST
Will be great if it supports mulyiple sources.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice app I wish there was an option to skip a particular image and go to the next instead of being stuck to a particular image that you don't like
FEATURE REQUEST
Missing educational value A one-tap widget that loads an art critics review of the current painting and its artist  describing his style and what it represents to the art world is needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app Would love the ability to center images from gallery.
FEATURE REQUEST
Add features Can you at least add no wallpaper scrolling and a widget to change the wallpaper?
FEATURE REQUEST
Same goes for adding nowPaper integration  just a black screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if the blur just fade out when you touch the screen and blured again with predefined amount of time of inactivity.
FEATURE REQUEST
Selecting Thanks for your awesome app  sometimes I choose my photos as the source and it would be better if I could use some selection in my gallery instead of adding every picture separately
FEATURE REQUEST
Ok I think an option to simply center the image should be included
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome but some images disappear when phone restarted It's great but every time I restart my phone  some image folders disappear(turn black) and so I'm forced to remove those images and re add them.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add a favorite option  so I can go back and see my favorite wallpapers and paintings?
FEATURE REQUEST
Good App It would be great if the pictures were scaled and centered on the screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
N4 4.4.4 Needs a way to center some wallpapers when in portrait mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs more daily wallpapers
FEATURE REQUEST
I have 7 extensions at this moment  i'd love an option to use all of them together.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only thing missing is an option to change what gesture focuses the image.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be even better if it was compatible with daydream
FEATURE REQUEST
There is option to select folder Have to select multiple images one by one  option to select folder would have been great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it Could you add an option to un-blur the photo while in the lockscreen?
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish there was better support for showing my own images.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can add in own  but I should be able to add Flowers  not just individual images.
FEATURE REQUEST
The finished effect is great but it would be nice to have control over the blur  the dimness and switching the blur on and off permanently
FEATURE REQUEST
If there's way to Have the wallpaper combine a bunch of these different extensions and cycle through them as one  that would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add duration of 5 minutes and 10 minutes.
FEATURE REQUEST
However I wish there was some way to save the wallpapers on the device so I can use it some other time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Two missing features!
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to reinstall many times
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to have the option to skip a featured artwork if it's not of our liking.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great design  needs some work.
FEATURE REQUEST
The design of the app is great  I know you are going to focus on memory optimization  but you need to add and change some things.
FEATURE REQUEST
There needs to be an option to disable downloads of wallpapers over mobile data.
FEATURE REQUEST
You also need to make the blur and dim sliders more responsive.
FEATURE REQUEST
You also need an NSFW checkbox  just in case there are those kind of paintings.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it would be nice to set up photo home position when were using a landscaped picture format as the back ground.
FEATURE REQUEST
The app is obviously constantly running and I need to uninstall to preserve battery life.
FEATURE REQUEST
I miss using this wallpaper!
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent App The fact that personal pictures can be configured as a background for my phone is great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I'd like to be able to set a minimum resolution  or a gesture to skip the image as once in a while I get a low rez image sneak through
FEATURE REQUEST
Limited I wish there was a way to resize  pan  or center the image so the intended part of your custom image would show on the wallpaper.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way out is then just to uninstall and reinstall the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just the Best The best random wallpaper app  no ads  tons of custom add on's and just beautiful wallpapers.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be just great to have Google Art Project integration with Muzei  and the possibility to change pictures with short intervals (20  30 minutes for ex) I would also like to change it considering artistic styles  so I can choose my fav.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if  when in detailed view  you could see the entire painting without scrolling.
FEATURE REQUEST
I should be able to adjust what part of the picture I see on my home screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish i cud change the ""double tap to see clearly feature"" like instead of double tap i want to use swipe up or swipe down or some other gesture as my phone has ""double tap on screen to lock feature"" which i dont want to change.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very well made It would be nice to have as source Flickr's featured photos.
FEATURE REQUEST
Since this is just really ugly I hopy you'll be able to fix it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Beautiful app but missing a critical feature!
FEATURE REQUEST
However  I wish the image would be in focus when the screen is locked.
FEATURE REQUEST
The actual Muzei app needs a refresh button or something.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is my favorite board game Would be great if it was more difficult  i win every time and have to make up challenges for myself  great game but will go tired if we can't incoperate another game difficulty.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add proper TLS cipher support!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
(lack of delete confirmation is dangerous :( ) Otherwise Fantastic and simple app just a couple of issues.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is not dev's fault  but should be made clear.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best but need just 1 more thing Im having Android 6 and that's why it's not showing on lockscreen...i want it on lock screen too..plz give update about it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Turn screen on Is it possible to turn on the screen on an event  like a missed call or new sms and for the screen to stay on?
FEATURE REQUEST
Frequently removes itself Seems like every few days in adding this widget to my phone again.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is no way to configure the app to appear on the lock screen as per the instructions.
FEATURE REQUEST
Extensions should be aligned center.
FEATURE REQUEST
...can you make an option to hide the scrollbar in the expanded widget?
FEATURE REQUEST
Could do with being able to see more than 3 widgets at the same time on the home screen though
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be nice if there was a widget that looked like the apps icon  that's why I downloaded it to begin with
FEATURE REQUEST
Great Love everything about it  though I would like options for the fenix extension to display just one  or two elements  instead of it being auto set to show all three.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome  should be built into OS Part of my default setup.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish the weather feature worked
FEATURE REQUEST
The developers really need to provide an update on this and deliver a fix.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's just one of those things you didn't know needed fixing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Since I use my tablet as my bedside clock I would like to be able to make the clock's font larger.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also would be nice to get some new date and time options thanks ?
FEATURE REQUEST
Works great  would be cool if there were more options for what to display.
FEATURE REQUEST
Should be part of Android- Love it I keep it fairly simple  but it's my home screen and I have it set to show missed calls or texts  wifi status  data usage  and a 'lock' where you can touch it and close the phone without hitting other buttons.
FEATURE REQUEST
Everyone needs this app!
FEATURE REQUEST
To make it work  I need to leave some free area on the screen  but this means  I cannot display everything I want in the wizard.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be great if I could find the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
The size isnt right Hope it can add a font size changing for either of the clock or the extensions.
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe there should be a manual refresh option?
FEATURE REQUEST
One tap exit would be nice It's nice that you can add extensions and all.
FEATURE REQUEST
With Dashclock though  a tap will only zoom in on the Daydream  you need to chase the unlit ""Back"" button to close the Daydream.
FEATURE REQUEST
Doesn't work Every time I add it to my home screen the launcher just crashes.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would give better rating If only there was a way to make it lock screen comparable for android 5+.
FEATURE REQUEST
Widget needs drop shadow I love the widget (sadly  no lock screen for my Samsung/TouchWiz)  the only problem would be using white/light font with a white/light wallpaper.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you maybe add some drop shadowing (like in next lock screen for example) by default or optionally?
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to add bit animation into background in order to get premium look .
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it but please add Android wear support!
FEATURE REQUEST
Great clock No need to make this complicated.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really like the minimalistic approach  but I'm only seen the weather  the clock and the Gmail data  even if I add some new ones.
FEATURE REQUEST
I had to install to review Why do u need all those Permisions.
FEATURE REQUEST
There's no enable widgets in settings so not sure how I can add a third party widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Hide extensions It would be nice if you could hide the extensions by tapping on the clock  on something like that
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs more base customizations for the clock itself.
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs to be fixed.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have used this for a long time now  but one thing I wish they would add is the option to have either an outline or dropshadow on the characters in your dashclock  because I love the simple white clock widget look  but on some backgrounds it is unreadable  and I don't like the look of the black option  or the option that has a background on the widget!
FEATURE REQUEST
Ok but stays portrait not landscape Would be better if it went landscape on my s6 edge plus so i can see it properly when sleeping only goes landscape in preview mode
FEATURE REQUEST
Unfortunate because it seems like exactly what I needed to move the location of my clock on the lock screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
No luck on Samsung Note 2 There is no way to enable this widget on the Samsung Note 2 lockscreen.
FEATURE REQUEST
I think you should add more design options because there's nothing special about that aspect
FEATURE REQUEST
What the Clock widget was missing this makes the clock widget a lot more useful!
FEATURE REQUEST
Possible Improvement: It would be nice to launch InBox - if it happens to be installed - instead of the default Gmail and then no settings choice option would even be required!
FEATURE REQUEST
favorite amazing and much loved - i agree it needs an update for lollipop
FEATURE REQUEST
Instead of only adjusting the transparency  I wish there was a setting were it would create a small shadow behind each character.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to fix!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty good but would like more 3rd party app extensions can you add an extension for MyMail or AquaMail?
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish they were available in binary version as well :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Beautiful The customization options are outstanding and lets not forget the main features which are really convenient though I wish you could chose your weather source though yahoo is somewhat inaccurate in my area
FEATURE REQUEST
Almost perfect Need to change text colour to whatever I want.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but limited The home screen widget works great  it would be better if we could change the size of the clock and text  and use other weather providers (like weather underground).
FEATURE REQUEST
An extension for Waze would be cool too  but i didn't look too hard to see if one existed.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's cool but needs some upgrades
FEATURE REQUEST
When I try to resize the widget  it is compressing all the data and showing only the icons of Weather & ToDoist extensions.
FEATURE REQUEST
I do wish there was more customization in this widget like adding some color.
FEATURE REQUEST
Feature request I love this widget  and recently changed to muzei and the form watchface to get a synced background between my phone and watch  can you add a form face for dashclock so everything looks the same  watch or phone?
FEATURE REQUEST
Cool but lack of customized design Good job but i hope you guys can add some customization options (fonts & color)
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish that clicking the date Wil take you to the calendar and the clock will take you to the clock app.
FEATURE REQUEST
:( Sadly this no longer works as a lockscreen widget on Lollipop please add lollipop lockscreen functionality.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to rate it 5 stars  but none of these seem to work.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could get this to run on my Note 4  specifically for the fitbit extensions  that'd be great!
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish we still had lock screen widgets!
FEATURE REQUEST
I do not use the default texting app on my phone  I need to be able to switch the short cut to the app I use.
FEATURE REQUEST
Again I love the app - it just needs some big fixes!
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice launcher.you can also change app drawer icons
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish it was compatible with lollipop like many of others  but everyone needs to realize that lockscreen widgets was removed from Android entirely as of 5.0.
FEATURE REQUEST
daydream problem We need an update  fast!
FEATURE REQUEST
Dang wish I didn't uninstall system version for this one -.
FEATURE REQUEST
Google Messenger Compatibility It would be great if you cold make it so when it you click on the text notification it will take you to Google Messenger if that's set as your default texting app.
FEATURE REQUEST
No am/pm support It's a nice widget but lacks AM/PM support.
FEATURE REQUEST
I miss using it!
FEATURE REQUEST
Handy app Could use more styles
FEATURE REQUEST
It looks too big on 5.5"" screen  so it takes space that could be fit for 2 notifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also I need the security on phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
I do wish the stock icons could be used instead of plain white or black ones.
FEATURE REQUEST
Love it .....please add more functions.
FEATURE REQUEST
they should have am option to expand to be able to see the other notifications when widget us not expanded
FEATURE REQUEST
Unable to get it to show on lock screen Am i missing something  tried everything to my knowledge and nothing.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent  should be included in stock Android This is an amazing widget  and the fact that it is extensible is awesome.
FEATURE REQUEST
Galaxy S4 Add custom weather refresh interval options!
FEATURE REQUEST
Organizer Widget came close but lacked MMS  K9  multiple email acciunts  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
Like missed call or SMS alert?
FEATURE REQUEST
You enable daydream and add it in the daydream settings.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really like dashclock and I will continue to use dashclock  but I would love it if there was a pass code plug-in so you could still have that security
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice if you updated app
FEATURE REQUEST
You can however still add the widget to your home screen from the app drawer  just not the lock screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very miss it on Lollipop :(
FEATURE REQUEST
Although I would like to see more customizations like clock fonts  size and appearance maybe.
FEATURE REQUEST
could you please add the option to upsize the time and date?
FEATURE REQUEST
Next This app hasnt been updated since 2013   IDK for the life of me why TF gaggle haz to leave these outdated old apps on the server  if an app hasnt been updated in 3 months it should be deleted  ok 1 yr now thats fair enough  but not updated since 2013 jeez google gimme a f'n break  this is old amd antiquated  out of date and most likely wont even work on lollipooper
FEATURE REQUEST
Anyone know if this will work for 5.0.
FEATURE REQUEST
Strong potential I really enjoyed the concept and design  however  the lack of customization and noticeable battery drain forced me to abandon it.
FEATURE REQUEST
Otherwise  this widget sounds awesome i just wish i could use it on my device.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need a way to remove notifications directly from lock screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Right now to remove any notifications from locks screen dashclock widget we need to touch particular notification then it opens particular app.
FEATURE REQUEST
It will be good if we can remove notification directly from lock screen dashclock widget by any way such as long press or swipe left/right.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really great step up This app would be perfect if I could lock me phone and it still be enabled.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need my phone locked with this app to still work!
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to swipe to show it.
FEATURE REQUEST
It may be used just for fun and wasting our time trying to use the apps.
FEATURE REQUEST
Developer need to fix this all.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great idea but no point if you can only use it when the the screen is set to no password lock.
FEATURE REQUEST
If they change it so you can use it with a lock password then I'll change my rating of the app.
FEATURE REQUEST
So much is missing good idea tho
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish that some of the apps that support the widget would take better care of them  or at least make then more customizable.
FEATURE REQUEST
The Bible verses from YouVersion bible app is the best widget in my nexus5 until all of a sudden (perhaps last update) the bible extension is missing
FEATURE REQUEST
Can you add more customization of color?
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add widget size setting
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to use this widget on my phone  but I will probably end up tossing it off my phone because it is too hard to set up (and I'm not one to give up that easy).
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add WhatsApp messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
We need more clock colors And it isn't clear how to change lockscreen widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to update this too
FEATURE REQUEST
Any fix to that would be great
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice start but needs a lot of work.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's OK  more options needed An option for a bigger clock on the home screen would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there would be a slider to change the transparency level instead of having preset options like 0%  25%  50%  .
FEATURE REQUEST
Nexus 5 Good but no need anymore after updated to Android 5.
FEATURE REQUEST
Keep up the good work  please add more widgets for exchange email and Facebook perhaps
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs an update After updating to Lollipop this app needs some updating as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Adding an Inbox extension would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
Go to lock screen settings  set your lock screen to swipe  enable multiple widgets under swipe options  go to lock screen  touch upper section of phone (not very top) and swipe down (a box should appear)  swipe left  touch ""+"" button  add widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
What am I missing?
FEATURE REQUEST
Amazing idea  kinda outdated I really like the app and use it on all of my devices  I would like new personalization options  material design  etc
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be better if the application is active while the lock screen is actually locked  that way not having to go through the process of placing passwords to unlock the phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Looks sleek on S4 Just need a separate option to open calendar if tapping on the date.
FEATURE REQUEST
What am I missing?
FEATURE REQUEST
Loved it A rooted device needs to be fancy!
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if this could be fixed.
FEATURE REQUEST
What I was looking for Works fine for me  some more customisation of the builtin extensions would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
No go on Galaxy S5 Unable to install on lock screen as installation instructions show.If there is a way please show...no choice but to Uninstall app till a fix is given
FEATURE REQUEST
Can make it main lockscreen htc one (m7) I don't know how to make it as my main lock screen it shows up as a widget and I have to scroll over to it if I want to use it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I also love the possibility of adding other extensions to the widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Custom Stock look Maintains that stock look  feel  & functionality while adding a few useful items that YOU WANT.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome Needs a refresh though
FEATURE REQUEST
Actually It's not compatible with 4.0.4 please work on it it Would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I don't even have the ""+"" to add a widget to my lock screen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Sadly GS5 lacks support.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very good Would be nice to have an extension that cycled through news headlines.
FEATURE REQUEST
And I would like an option for it to automatically swipe when a certain notification comes.
FEATURE REQUEST
Why in the world would I not be able to use this on my s5!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Thanks for adding appearance tweaks!
FEATURE REQUEST
When I try to switch the temperature unit to Celsius  it won't change.
FEATURE REQUEST
Quite handy app Still needs improvment like font/row size changes to reduce ""elefant size"" messages on huge & 320dpi screens.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is what I needed I followed the instructions listed above and no problems.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  would love to see some tweaks like separate instances between lockscreen (ls) and a homescreen (hs) panel.
FEATURE REQUEST
Wish the developer would do something about the drain.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app was awesome But I hate that you can't add widgets to the lockscreen on the S5  I wish there was a work around!
FEATURE REQUEST
But there really really needs to be more clocks and date's to choose from.
FEATURE REQUEST
Excellent Fantastic   just gives me what i need on my homescreen!
FEATURE REQUEST
Really Handy Must have app  sums up everything you need to know and puts it where you want it
FEATURE REQUEST
I used to tweak my lock screen constantly trying to find a setup I was satisfied with For the last 8-10 months I've used this exclusively and rarely even think about what I might be missing elsewhere
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome All is good  just needs an option to increase the clock size.
FEATURE REQUEST
Please add this Please add a myMail notifications.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good idea but not getting what i want Great app diffently going to use it however  please add a way where i can have the extensions on both sides of the clock.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great clock widget Need an update for att lg g3 for the widget when tapping the clock goes directly to the stock clock app as I use my alarm a lot.
FEATURE REQUEST
It's nice  but lacks customization.
FEATURE REQUEST
Cudnt replace the lock screen clock need further instruction.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also  for those who are giving it a low raring because it doesn't work on secure lockscreens  you need to understand that Android doesn't allow widgets under a secure lockscreen
FEATURE REQUEST
Fantastic Just one quarm; you need to tell the user to swipe in order to remove an extension  I spent way too long trying to figure that out .
FEATURE REQUEST
Maybe the instructions were meant to be confusing but this should have a low maturity bc of install time (time it's on a device).
FEATURE REQUEST
I really want to use it but there's no point since I need to protect my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you make it so it always displays all the extensions in detail?
FEATURE REQUEST
Too limited  need to open to more types of notification
FEATURE REQUEST
For example  it would be nice if we could skip and pause music.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great if we could change the size of the clock.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be great.
FEATURE REQUEST
I could.add it to my home screen only.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish we could see a few more appearance options.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lacks customization features I would like if your had more font colour and a better security features for 5 stars!
FEATURE REQUEST
Slick and understated This looks like something that should be baked into android.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice if android allowed you to set lock screen widgets to use the full screen though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Security Need some freaking security.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also when adding new extensions the scroll menu dissapears short after clicking it.
FEATURE REQUEST
People  if you can only add widgets to Swipe to unlock screen it is your phone fault not DashClock.
FEATURE REQUEST
Pretty good Good app but could you add a setting to add the widget in the notification bar
FEATURE REQUEST
Furthermore  as far as I remember you could always use password or pattern security for the lock screen widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just one more thing It would be so awesome if you could just add Viber extension (unread messages and calls) :)
FEATURE REQUEST
Problem with hiding the clock If I hide the clock on the home screen  there is no way to go to the preference page
FEATURE REQUEST
Love all the options I just wished it would have a shadow capability so you could read the white text/font when it it a lighter wallpaper.
FEATURE REQUEST
Fonts are too big It would be great if there is an option to adjust font size.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple and elegant This beautiful and simple extension incorporates lock screen widgets the way that they should have been implemented in the first place.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the daydream mode would allow you to choose dim for night and day.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you don't have this already  you need it.
FEATURE REQUEST
This is another thing stock Android should be able to do but doesn't.
FEATURE REQUEST
Something needed I think it needs to have discard notification button or etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you could not show notifications of archived conversations that would be great  even if they ate unread.
FEATURE REQUEST
It keeps on going back to my stock htc one lock screen  also I would Like to see a Twitter extension XD
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome apps would be better if it could handle all the notification by itself or if dash notifier for dashclock was intergrated
FEATURE REQUEST
Have to swipe to see extensions I thought I would be able to turn on my phone screen and have the info there  but I have to swipe down to view them.
FEATURE REQUEST
There should at least be an option to have them in full view all the time.
FEATURE REQUEST
Also it would be nice to be able to swipe away extensions from the lockscreen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Feature Broken on Galaxy S5 KitKat Opening missed calls from the homescreen widget causes Contacts to force close.
FEATURE REQUEST
It just needs more customizing options.
FEATURE REQUEST
That's a shame it will only work with absolutely no security added to the lock screen itself.
FEATURE REQUEST
Good but needs improvement in daydream mode Great lock screen app but lacking in daydream mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
If you can add an option to remove the background  that would be great!
FEATURE REQUEST
Good  but please add black outline to fonts!!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Cool stuff I'd be great if I can customize the font  size  and color of the text.
FEATURE REQUEST
The only way to get rid of the notification is if I open the text through Dash Clock specifically.
FEATURE REQUEST
Battery bug Any battery extension that I add doesn't keep up with the battery percentage.
FEATURE REQUEST
I have dashclock on my lock screen and my home screen  I need different information in those two places.
FEATURE REQUEST
Awesome I need my yahoo account to be added..please do some...so 4 stars
FEATURE REQUEST
This is exactly what I needed to display notifications on Nexus 5 lockscreen.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would happily rate 5 stars if that could be done.
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish there was a setting to change the transparency of the notification icons.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see however an option to see AM/PM shown on the clock option of the widget.
FEATURE REQUEST
Very flexible and easy to use I only wish I could set Muzei (or my current wallpaper) as my background when using Dashclock in Daydream mode.
FEATURE REQUEST
This way it constantly show all the information I needed to see while charging my phone.
FEATURE REQUEST
Can add various other extensions like say Whatsapp notification without having sperate apps for the same
FEATURE REQUEST
Elegant Does exactly what I need a home screen clock to do  and it does it on my lock screen as well!
FEATURE REQUEST
i wish there'll be an update for analog clock and also local time based on location.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would love to use this app but the server seems not work on Ubuntu Mate  maybe it happens because its gtk2 log: Installing Python dependencies.
FEATURE REQUEST
You need to enable Notification Access for linconnect in Security settings in Android.
FEATURE REQUEST
Server side needs some fixing and might not show notifications with percent values in text.
FEATURE REQUEST
I've installed the server on Ubuntu 12.04 with no trouble  although some fiddling needs to be done if you want the notifications to properly appear on a Gnome desktop (upper right corner with the rest of them).
FEATURE REQUEST
Flawless Needed an app to set my voip extension quickly and it had to be reliable.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great free SIP client When forwarding calls  would be great it's not direct but to allow returning to the caller and talking to the target number too.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app needs a timed log out password.
FEATURE REQUEST
To get it to receive msgs I need to have the app in the the open app list and if I have it opened it shows a persistent notification in the notification drawer.
FEATURE REQUEST
It needs to be optimized to use little less resources and should ideally integrate well with the android OS
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish the developer could provide an option to delete old/obsolete feeds though.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great apps Please add amoled theme with black background and white font.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be nice to get it back or at least if that button would be configurable.
FEATURE REQUEST
Still lack of features
FEATURE REQUEST
Only question  can I make the articles I've already read be hidden or gone?
FEATURE REQUEST
Great app  but better podcast support + feed discovery would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
Miss the ability to see the full article.
FEATURE REQUEST
good but it lacks 3 basic features Good app overall but it needs a 1.
FEATURE REQUEST
Simple  serves what I need.
FEATURE REQUEST
Some of my feeds needs login so need authentication option for my feeds.
FEATURE REQUEST
However  it would be great if there was some way to back up my starred feeds either online or offline?
FEATURE REQUEST
It also should have a choice to hide that button.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to see an option to choose where to download.
FEATURE REQUEST
But can you add a delete post button / function.
FEATURE REQUEST
Lack of integration If it was integrated better with commercial services it will definitely win my 5 stars.
FEATURE REQUEST
Nice Please add manual refresh on widged
FEATURE REQUEST
Stumbled on this and wish that I had found it earlier.
FEATURE REQUEST
Best out there still add more features I used to be long time user of Taptu.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to add more features with updates.
FEATURE REQUEST
It only lacks one thing .
FEATURE REQUEST
Needs a few tweaks to improve.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to fix these to improve the user experience.
FEATURE REQUEST
no refund period I had to buy the app to realise it is not what I needed.
FEATURE REQUEST
If there is no free or trial version there should at least be a refund ability.
FEATURE REQUEST
We need more feature-rich and usable apps like this in the world.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but needs more Please add options for presence/status indicators next to contacts and the option for a persistent notification when signed in (I like knowing I'm still online)
FEATURE REQUEST
Fav Stop Times on App Home Screen It would be good if you could automatically show the mins until departure for your favourite stops on the startup screen
FEATURE REQUEST
Need to see the quotes again.
FEATURE REQUEST
I need to get off one stop before that.
FEATURE REQUEST
But it would be even better if you could group your favourites like in tramTRACKER
FEATURE REQUEST
Other versions have this feature but lack the easy bookmarking ability.
FEATURE REQUEST
Indispensible We need this for Melbourne's buses as well.
FEATURE REQUEST
Need no other Need no other tram app for Melbourne.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great  simple  responsive  and it delvers just the info you need to get around
FEATURE REQUEST
If the author could add one more feature of sorting favourite that would be even better.
FEATURE REQUEST
Handy I rarely catch trams but have found this app a gem when I've needed to tram it somewhere.
FEATURE REQUEST
This needs some attention.
FEATURE REQUEST
All the functionality you need to travel by tram in Melbourne.
FEATURE REQUEST
Just one request: could you add a feature allowing for the selection of several photos at once?
FEATURE REQUEST
Once selected there is no way to change it.
FEATURE REQUEST
For those with the same problem  where send reduced always opens with a certain app but you would like to be able to select the app  try Settings (the main Android settings)  Applications  Application Manager  the application that always opens with send reduced e.g. Outlook  Viber  etc  then ""Set as default""  and ""clear defaults"".
FEATURE REQUEST
I wish everyone sending me bloat-size photos would use this.
FEATURE REQUEST
A bigger improvement should be made asap.
FEATURE REQUEST
It'd be better if it checks that setting beforehand and decide what to do
FEATURE REQUEST
so far ok I've had it 4 three days now so far it's ok it's turning my screen on when I get any type of notification  and I like putting my phone on silent but was missing messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
I also like the feature where you can chose which apps that you want this to work with.
FEATURE REQUEST
I can't figure out why you NEED this app on a ""SMART PHONE"".
FEATURE REQUEST
No more missed calls or texts that I don't get notified about except by a stupid LED.
FEATURE REQUEST
Missed Screen Wake up which was a standard on old phones which are better than LED and Vibration alerts.
FEATURE REQUEST
And instead of editing which to have wake screen after getting notification for an app  app selection menu would be nice.
FEATURE REQUEST
I really liked it with Lollipop  but had to uninstall on Marshmallow because though the screen still woke for notifications  there were no sounds anymore so I was missing a lot of messages.
FEATURE REQUEST
On Android 6 you will need to delay the screen or the sound will stop playing.
FEATURE REQUEST
But I would like to see the notifications I get in the lock screen be pulled down not all clumped on one notification.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be nice to have an option like this.
FEATURE REQUEST
I would like to day it's great  and it is - for about a day  then it turns itself off.
FEATURE REQUEST
Great but needs improvement On Samsung S7 running the Android 6.0 the app has a conflict with the security policies.
FEATURE REQUEST
When I get a notification that I want to interact with  the screen turns off just as I try to unlock.
FEATURE REQUEST
Would be better if the app bailed out if it senses screen interaction
FEATURE REQUEST
I really wish this app would work on my phone
FEATURE REQUEST
The best Just what I needed..thanks.
FEATURE REQUEST
Does exactly what I need it to do The ambient display feature on the Nexus 6 is terrible and no one should use it.
FEATURE REQUEST
I just wish it had a reminder option.
FEATURE REQUEST
So  this app is perfect  i only have one ""issue"" that would be really satisfying if you can cahnge it permanently  or add it as a feature.
FEATURE REQUEST
So when the screen wakes  it doesnt matter if i touch or not  its still gonna go back to black after X seconds  and would be really nice if it wakes up and i touch the screen or start interacting it would stay awake until i make it go to sleep or until the timer makes it sleep automatically.
FEATURE REQUEST
This app wakes my screen up when I receive notifications without any 3rd party lock screen and I can use my finger print lock screen!!
FEATURE REQUEST
Didn't realize how much I needed it until it was installed.
FEATURE REQUEST
After getting frustrated with the lack of an obvious feature that should be in the menu of my phone  I looked it up and sure enough I found this app.
FEATURE REQUEST
Really nice I use it whenever I need to play games on ds
FEATURE REQUEST
Difficult Navigation I have multiple ROMs downloaded  but for some reason the app only shows one  and there is no way in the app to look for my other games.
FEATURE REQUEST
There is also no way to skip frame rate  turn off sound  etc.
FEATURE REQUEST
If these two problems could be fixed for the S6  that would be awesome.
FEATURE REQUEST
This I soo slow all I ask is a speed button PLEASE add this cuz itz soo slow PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
FEATURE REQUEST
Could you add a help button or something?
FEATURE REQUEST
Low fps need fast foward mode
FEATURE REQUEST
one problem i cant load my quicksave and it would be nice if it ran faster.
FEATURE REQUEST
This still needs improvements like a fast forward button where you can speed up the text or whatever.
FEATURE REQUEST
Second  this app needs to save the games we play because once you uninstall this and reinstall it then the games you played and saved will be gone  bye bye.
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be good to have some features like the Gameboy emulator where when you uninstall that app it then saves your game data and then you can still continue where you left off
FEATURE REQUEST
One suggestion Most of it is fine but can u please add a speeding up option?
FEATURE REQUEST
It crashed my game When I was playing it crashed out of no where and it's super slow devoloper I need you to reply help me out here then you can get the other 4 stars

Should read battery_current_now  not battery_current I seem to be on a ""quest"" to find any app/widget/piece of software that will do one simple task: read the battery current sensor in ""relative real-time"" - that is  as the CPU scales up and down  GPU kicks in and out  4G modem does its dance  and as all the little things of the system do their work  I can see the immediate response in the current that is MEASURED BY MY PHONE'S SENSOR.

Good but could be more convenient 1) Please allow editing of plaintext once decrypted (it's very inconvenient to have to copy and paste it in a new page then edit text each time you want to change/add or remove something)  2) Please allow encryption of multiple files at once (inconvenient to have to zip them before encryption)  3) Please add support for more algorithms and hashes such as Twofish and Whirlpool (for people who don't trust the""standard"" algorithms) Thanks
